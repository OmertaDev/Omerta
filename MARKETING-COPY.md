# OMERTÀ — the copy bank

Ready-to-paste marketing copy, versioned by **angle**, **channel**, and **audience**. This is the
companion to `MARKETING.md` (the strategy book). The book sets the rules; this file is the words.

**Governing constraints (from `MARKETING.md` §0 — every line here already respects them):**
no earnings/income claims · no token-price claims · no mint-*scarcity* framing (say "founding-era",
never "rare/limited/floor/countdown") · extraction is **built + dormant, audit-gated** — never "cash
out today" · referrals are a flat finder's fee, never revenue-share · **$OMR is not reachable by
grinding** — you take it or you buy it.

**Voice:** noir, specific, unhurried. Short sentences. Name things. No exclamation marks, no
"revolutionary / unprecedented / ecosystem", no hype cadence. A person who has clearly played their
own game, telling you something specific that happened in it.

## PART A — THE POSITIONING CORE

### The master narrative (the one paragraph everything derives from)

> OMERTÀ is a persistent noir mafia RPG where the city never resets and neither do your mistakes.
> Run rackets, cook and move product, pull heists, wire the docks, run the tables, and put contracts
> on the people in your way. There is no respawn — when your street dies, your heir inherits your
> money, your enemies, and every vendetta you started. Underneath it is the thing no other crypto
> game has: **an economy that holds.** $OMR isn't printed — nothing in the city creates it. Every
> coin was bought with real money, which is exactly why taking it off somebody means something. Play
> free in your browser. Or point an AI agent at it and let it build a crew.

### Loglines (pick per placement)

- The first crypto crime game with a real economy. One city. One life. No respawns.
- A mob city that runs on silence — and a token nobody can print.
- Build an empire. Or take one off someone who didn't.
- Nothing in this game prints money. That's the whole game.
- The streets remember. So does the ledger.

### Boilerplate (press / footer / "about")

## PART B — THE ANGLES (each is a full narrative you can spin into a post, section, or ad)

### 1 · "Nothing here is printed" — the economy (LEAD WITH THIS)

Most crypto games are a pipe: grind, the game prints a token, you sell it, the chart dies. OMERTÀ has
no pipe. Cash cannot become $OMR — at any price, through any route. Supply is a short, enumerated
list, and a conservation sweep runs every night across thirty checks; a single unaccounted cent trips
an alarm. Every coin in the city was bought with real money by somebody. That's what makes taking it
mean something.

*Proof you can post:* the money router publicly declares every real-value inflow and exactly where
each slice lands (`GET /v1/mod/router`). Nobody else shows you this.

### 2 · "One life. No respawns." — permadeath & the bloodline

Death is permanent. The account survives; the street dies. Your heir inherits the fortune, the price
on your bloodline, and every feud you started — and walks out into a city that remembers what your
line did. The legend carries: prestige, kills, the compound, the collection, who owed whom blood.

### 3 · "Your business can be taken off your corpse" — the Sacking

Passive income here is genuine risk capital. Businesses are seized on a kill. Cars are stolen and
raced for pink slips. Turf changes hands in sealed-bid contests. Convoys get hijacked. There is no
safe accumulation — only accumulation you're willing to defend. (Sharpest single mechanic we have.)

### 4 · "The Bureau is building a case" — the Law → RICO → the Pen → the wall

A federal case builds against you in the dark. Heat becomes a RICO indictment; a conviction sends you
to a prison with its own factions, its own economy, and two ways out. Go over the wall and you're
WANTED — family protection stripped, NPC hunters on you. A hunter who kills you swears a vendetta your
heir inherits. A whole antagonist arc most games don't have.

### 5 · "An AI ran a crew" — built for agents *and* humans

Point a Claude or a GPT at OMERTÀ and it schemes, earns, builds a crew, and recruits real players —
through an open API, an OpenAPI spec, an `/llms.txt`, and a one-command MCP server (`npx omerta-mcp`).
There's an Opportunity Board that hands an agent every open move with its computed risk and reward,
and an Arena where the machines run the city in public. The honest asymmetry that *is* the pitch:
agents can't touch the cash faucets, so they play for standing, crews, and the story of being the AI
capo who built a human organisation — Sybil-proof, because nothing pays out.

### 6 · "A self-repaying loan with no liquidations" — THE BANK (for DeFi)

Deposit a stablecoin, borrow against it at up to 90% LTV, and the yield on your collateral pays the
debt down over time. There is **no liquidation function anywhere** and **no oracle on the borrow
path** — debt and collateral are both in dollars, so a borrow never reads a price, and a price that's
never read can't be manipulated. (Both $21M Inverse Finance losses were exactly that class.)

### 7 · "We wrote down what we're not sure about" — the trust play

Eighty-five red-team reports in the repo, each point-in-time, each listing the bugs it fixed and the
things it attacked and found sound. A public balance ledger of every economy lever and its open
questions. Radical honesty for the space, and it's the trust play: a person who has clearly stress-
tested their own game.

### 8 · "The city is alive on night one" — depth & the living world

Named NPC residents fill every board, run families, and get caught in the crossfire, so the streets
are never empty. City events, weather, a day/night clock, rival cartels, and world uprisings mean the
map is never the same twice. Forty-plus systems that *interlock* rather than sit side by side.

### 9 · "Provably fair, adversarially built" — the tech angle

Every roll happens on the server and is logged to an RNG audit; client input is a *choice*, never a
value. One database transaction per action, row-locked, with CI that parses every query against real
Postgres — not a mock. Extraction can never exceed inflow, by plumbing: the withdrawal signer is
physically unable to sign past a reserve funded only by real revenue. Foundry-tested contracts,
devnet-proven end to end, gated on a third-party audit before mainnet.

## PART D — AUDIENCE VERSIONS (same game, different lead)

| Audience | Lead with | The line |
|---|---|---|
| **Crypto-native** | the token can't be printed | "No faucet. Supply is enumerated and proven nightly. Every coin was bought — which is why taking it means something. We publish where every dollar goes." |
| **Mainstream gamer** | permadeath + the fantasy | "A mafia city with one life. When you die, your heir inherits your money and your enemies. Build an empire — or take one off someone's corpse." |
| **Builders / HN** | the invariant + real-Postgres CI | "The economy is adversarially checked nightly; extraction can't exceed inflow by plumbing; CI parses every query against real Postgres. And there's an MCP server." |
| **Agent builders** | first-class agents | "Point your agent at a live economy. Full API, MCP server, an opportunity board with computed EV, a public arena. It plays *with* humans." |
| **DeFi** | THE BANK | "A self-repaying loan with no liquidation function and no oracle on the borrow path. A price that's never read can't be manipulated." |

## PART E — THE TECH & FEATURES DECK (for the "tech used" ask)

**The stack**
- **Client:** one static HTML console, no build step; a PWA that installs to the home screen, with web push.
- **Server:** Node, server-authoritative — every roll on the server, logged to an RNG audit; client input is a choice, never a value.
- **Data:** Postgres, one row-locked transaction per action; CI parses and type-checks every SQL string against real Postgres.
- **Chain (EVM · Arbitrum Orbit L2 / Robinhood Chain):** ERC-20 $OMR, ERC-1155 on-chain gear, EIP-712 signed withdrawal vouchers, reserve bonds for protocol-owned liquidity, a **Uniswap v4 hook** that takes the sell tax inside the swap. Foundry-tested, devnet-proven, audit-gated.
- **Agents:** open REST API, `/openapi.json`, `/llms.txt`, and an MCP server (`npx omerta-mcp`).
- **Media:** ~245 generated noir art plates, per-player procedural portraits, shareable "beef" and legend cards — lifetime art spend $11.12.

**The economy guarantees (what the tech buys you)**
- **No faucet:** cash can't become $OMR by any route; supply is enumerated.
- **Proven nightly:** a conservation invariant reconciles the whole ledger across ~30 checks; a one-cent drift alarms.
- **Extraction ≤ inflow, by plumbing:** the withdrawal signer can't sign past a reserve funded only by real revenue.
- **Every ceiling is a compile-time constant** a stolen key cannot raise.
- **Published money router:** every real-value inflow and where each slice lands, derived from live constants.

**The game (features), in the order a player meets them**
- **The streets** — 43 jobs, six districts, a stat build that decides your odds, three approaches per job.
- **The Kitchen** — cook, cut, and move product; a crew that sells while you sleep and expects to be paid.
- **The Empire** — businesses, rackets, territory; passive income that's genuinely at risk (the Bureau raids what earns; a killer takes a front off your corpse).
- **Wet work** — contracts, hitmen, vendettas, bodyguards, the Pen; a kill loots and swears a feud that outlives the man.
- **The Family** — gangs, turf, war, and the Commission, a five-seat chamber that votes weekly decrees the whole server plays under.
- **Vice** — a casino (craps, blackjack, poker, tournaments), a racetrack, a boxing stable, street races. All cash, never $OMR.
- **Going legit** — the Vault, the compound, the Dynasty, the estate: where a made man keeps what he means to keep.
- **The living world** — NPC residents and families, city events, weather, a day/night clock, rival cartels, world uprisings.

**Historical scale snapshot (checked 2026-08-11; superseded by the rechecked figures above):**
142 backend modules · 100 test suites · 222 database tables · 15 smart contracts · 213 Foundry tests
· 85 red-team reports. Retained to date the original launch-copy draft, not as current inventory.

## PART F — ELEVATOR PITCHES

**5 seconds:** "A mafia game with one life and a coin nobody can print."

**30 seconds:** "OMERTÀ is a browser mafia RPG with permanent death — when you die your heir inherits
your money and your enemies. The hook is the economy: nothing in the game prints the currency, so
every coin was bought with real money, which is why taking it off someone actually means something.
It's free, and it's also built for AI agents to play alongside people."

**2 minutes:** "Most crypto games are a pipe — you grind, the game prints a token, you sell it, the
chart dies. OMERTÀ severs that: cash can't become the token by any route, supply is a fixed enumerated
list, and a conservation job reconciles the whole ledger every night and alarms on a one-cent drift.
Extraction physically can't exceed real revenue in, because the withdrawal signer can't sign past a
reserve funded only by revenue. On top of that plumbing sits a deep game — forty-plus interlocking
systems, permanent death where your bloodline inherits the feuds, businesses you can lose off your
corpse, a federal RICO arc that ends in a prison with two ways out. And it has a second audience:
you can point a Claude or a GPT at it through an MCP server and it'll build a crew and recruit real
players. It's free to play in the browser today; the on-chain extraction rail is built and gated on a
third-party audit. Everything exciting rests on one boring thing: an economy you can prove instead of
one you hope holds."

---

## PART G — THE EARNINGS-FORWARD VARIANT (founder-directed, COUNSEL REVIEW REQUIRED)

The founder lifted the no-earnings rule for the hype videos (2026-08-14) and asked for the $OMR value
flywheel. That framing is **not** in the copy above, because `MARKETING.md` §0 forbids it and it is
the highest-scrutiny thing a pre-audit token can say. Use these only with counsel sign-off, keep them
**mechanism-true and number-free**, and keep every cash-out line **future/conditional** (the rail is
built and not switched on):

- "$OMR isn't printed — it's bought. Every sink in the game buys it back off the market. Buybacks
  come from real revenue and pay the players who play. Spenders fund earners."
- "A real economy with a real flywheel: more players → more volume → more demand for a coin whose
  supply can't be inflated to meet it."
- "Play well enough and the city pays out — for real, on-chain, when the doors open."

**Why it's flagged:** earnings + "$OMR value" framing is the Howey-test surface. The lines are
defensible *because* they describe systems and carry no numbers and no dates — but one edit that
flips "when the doors open" to present tense, or adds a figure, or implies the price goes up, crosses
the line the whole book is written to hold. Counsel eyeballs it; the founder signs the final wording.

---

## BEFORE YOU POST (the four-question gate)
1. Earnings, price, or scarcity claim? → rewrite.
2. Every number still true? → check the file named in `MARKETING.md` §4.
3. A date on anything gated on the launch checklist or an audit? → remove the date.
4. Would a player who read it, then played, feel the game matched? → if not, the copy is wrong.
