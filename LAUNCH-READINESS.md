# OMERTÀ — launch readiness checklist and plan

**Written 2026-08-11.** The gated plan. `GTM.md` says who we are reaching and in what order;
`MARKETING.md` says what we say; this says **what has to be true before each door opens, and who
decides.**

Two rules govern the whole document:

1. **A gate is not a task.** Tasks can be worked around under pressure; gates cannot. Where something
   is a gate it says so, and the correct response to a red gate is to move the date, never the gate.
2. **Verified state only.** Everything marked ✅ was checked against the tree on 2026-08-11 with the
   command named beside it. Anything unverified is marked ⬜ even where it is probably fine — an
   unchecked box that "should be OK" is how a launch finds out at 3am.

## THE THREE DOORS

There are three distinct launches here and conflating them is the main way this goes wrong.

| | What opens | Gated on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DOOR 1 — the game** | Real players in a live city. No chain, no token sale, no real-money extraction. | Engineering + ops readiness only | **Effectively open.** Blocked only by the Phase-0 activation items below. |
| **DOOR 2 — the agent channel** | Segment B: MCP directories, Show HN, `/arena`. | Door 1 populated | **OPEN** — `omerta-mcp@1.0.0` is live on npm (verified 2026-08-11); 1.0.1 republish pending via the publish workflow. |
| **DOOR 3 — the chain** | Genesis window, pool, community drop, on-chain extraction. | Third-party audit **and** the launch checklist **and** `forge test` | **Hard-blocked.** Two of three gates are red and neither is ours to close alone. |

**Doors 1 and 2 do not wait for Door 3.** That separation is the single most important structural
decision in this plan: it means we can launch a game, learn from real players, and fix what they
find, months before anything touches real money — and it means a slipped audit does not slip the
product.

# DOOR 1 — the game

## 1.1 Engineering gates ✅ *(all verified 2026-08-11)*

| Gate | Command | State |
|---|---|---|
| Full suite green | `npm test` | ✅ 100 suites |
| §10.4 conservation drift-0 | `node tools/sim.js` | ✅ ends `§10.4 holds exactly` |
| Every SQL string parses on **real** Postgres | `npm run pgquery` | ✅ (pg-mem cannot see the `uuid = text` class that took production down on 2026-07-30) |
| Loop / lock / ledger integrity on real Postgres | `npm run pgcheck` | ✅ 43/43 |
| Mobile layout, real Chromium, two viewports | `npm run mobile` | ✅ |
| Client wiring — every button reaches a real route, sends fields the handler reads, and reads fields the board sends | `node test/client.js` | ✅ 7 checks |
| Contracts | `cd omerta-contracts && forge test` | ✅ 531/531 across 27 suites (2026-08-27) |
| Docs match the tree | `node test/docs.js` | ✅ |
| Signed levers pinned + register complete | `node test/levers.js` | ✅ |

**Ground rule #8 applies to all of it: a green `npm test` is not a green build.** The suite runs on
pg-mem. Before any push that touches SQL, run `pgquery` + `pgcheck` locally, and **after every push,
read CI** — a red build that nobody reads manufactures confidence, which is how seven commits once
landed on top of a broken one.

## 1.2 Phase-0 activation ⬜ *(no engineering — this is deploy config, and it is the whole gap)*

Read `/admin → Integrations` for live state and exact steps. Do not work from this table; work from
that screen.

- [ ] **Web push** — `node tools/vapid.js`, set `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` + `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` on **both**
      the API (serves the public key) and the worker (does the sending), redeploy.
      *Highest-ROI retention item we own. On iOS it works only from the installed PWA, which we ship.*
- [ ] **X one-click sign-in** — register an X app; set `X_CLIENT_ID`, `X_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PUBLIC_URL`;
      register the callback as `PUBLIC_URL + /v1/auth/x/callback`.
      *Without it we are asking X users to paste a bearer token. Nobody does that.*
- [ ] **Discord city wire** — create a **public community channel** webhook, set
      `CITY_WIRE_WEBHOOK_URL` on the API.
      ⚠ **Must be a different webhook from `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL`.** Preflight hard-errors if they
      match — city drama on the ops-alarm channel is both a leak and an alarm nobody will read.
- [ ] **Confirm `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL` reaches a human.** Preflight warns when unset; nothing can
      warn that the channel is muted. Post a test alert and watch someone receive it.

## 1.3 Ops readiness ⬜

- [ ] `npm run preflight` **on the box, with the real environment loaded.** Green means it will boot.
- [ ] `/health` returns 200 **and** `worker.stale` is false. The worker is a separate process and the
      sole source of every proactive alarm and every timed settlement — its silence is
      indistinguishable from a quiet night, which is exactly why the heartbeat exists.
- [ ] Backups: `npm run backup` completes and **verifies** (it restores the dump and counts rows — a
      schema-only dump passes a size check and holds nothing).
- [ ] The archiver watchdog reads `ok` on `/admin`, not `failing`/`off`. `archive_mode=off` means
      there is no WAL chain at all, which the first cut of that check reported as healthy.
- [ ] `autoDeployTrigger: checksPass` is set in `render.yaml` ✅ *(verified)* — a red CI cannot
      auto-ship.
- [ ] Decide and write down: who is on call, and what they do when the §10.4 alarm fires at 3am. The
      answer is "read `/admin → invariants`, find the check that is red, and page the developer" —
      but it needs to be written before it is needed.
- [ ] **Sweep the test debris out of the player population** (needs `MOD_KEY`). Every smoke run and
      deploy check that created a character left one behind, and nothing counting heads can tell them
      from players. `DISCOVERY.SEEN_DAYS` now hides anyone untouched for 30 days from the discovery
      and collision boards ✅ — so players never see them — but they still inflate every population
      figure the baseline is about to freeze, and the baseline cannot be redone later. Then the
      policy: a smoke run that creates a character deletes it, or names it sweepably.
- [ ] **Walk the funnel yourself, as a first player, on the real box.** The suite proves the code
      does what it says; this asks whether a stranger arriving cold has a good first ten minutes.
      Every defect it has found was invisible to green tests — the 2026-08-20 rehearsal found the
      "real players near you" board reading 10 of 12 dead accounts, with nothing broken and every row
      correctly listed. `LAUNCH-NIGHT.md` carries it as a T-minus step.

## 1.4 Content and copy ⬜

- [ ] `/wiki` and `docs/WIKI.md` agree with the tree ✅ *(drift detector + the `$OMR` figure guard in
      `test/docs.js`)*
- [ ] The five never-claim rules are on the wall for whoever writes public copy — including Discord
      replies, which is where an earnings claim actually happens.
- [ ] The landing page, `/arena`, `/play` and `/agents` all resolve and describe the current build ✅
- [ ] `SOCIAL_GAME_URL` / `PUBLIC_URL` point at the live host. *(The default fallback pointed at a
      dead domain until 2026-08-09; every brag/referral link derives from it.)*

## 1.5 The launch night itself ⬜

- [ ] **Pick a start night and recruit toward it.** Ten players arriving together find each other; ten
      arriving across ten days each find an empty city. This is the highest-leverage tactic in the
      plan and it costs nothing.
- [ ] Baseline written down **before** anyone arrives: `/admin` funnel, engagement, screen reach,
      coach census. Week two tells us nothing without week one.
- [ ] `INVITE_MODE` decided. On = a controlled cohort and a real Sybil bound; off = open doors. For a
      seeded first night, **on** is the better answer.
- [ ] Founder present and playing. In a game about families, running one is content.
- [ ] Read the coach census the next morning (`GET /v1/mod/coach`). A rung half the base is sitting on
      is the drop-off, and it names its own fix.

# DOOR 2 — the agent channel

- [x] **`npm publish` from `omerta-mcp/`.** ✅ DONE — `omerta-mcp@1.0.0` is live on the registry
      (verified 2026-08-11: `npx -y omerta-mcp` installs and connects), so the copy-paste config in
      `/play`, `AGENTS.md` and the MCP README is real. A **1.0.1 republish is queued** (README +
      tool-copy fixes; run the publish workflow).
- [x] `omerta-mcp` is publish-shaped ✅ — `files`, `repository`, `homepage`, `keywords`,
      `publishConfig.access: public`, `bin` + shebang all present.
- [x] `/play` — three-step no-code setup, vendor-neutral (MCP is an open protocol; ChatGPT, Cursor,
      Cline, Zed and the OpenAI Agents SDK all speak it) ✅
- [x] `/arena` + `GET /v1/arena` — public, keyless, wealth **banded** so a public indexed page can
      never be scanned for an agent's exact liquid ✅
- [x] `/openapi.json` — derived from the live route registry (so it cannot drift), `/v1/mod` excluded
      ✅
- [x] `robots.txt` welcomes every crawler and agent explicitly, pointing at `/llms.txt` ✅
- [ ] Write the technical post. One honest piece: how the API is shaped, why agents are first-class
      players, what the anti-Sybil walls are, and why agents are excluded from human status axes. Take
      it to Show HN and the MCP directories.
- [ ] Verify the published package end-to-end from a clean machine before posting anywhere.

# DOOR 3 — the chain

**Hard-gated. Nothing below ships until all four gates are green — and the two still open (the
security audit and Uniswap Labs routing review) are not ours to close alone.** `CHAIN-DEPLOY.md` §0 is
the chain authority; `UNISWAP-ROUTING.md` is the routing authority.

| Gate | State | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — `forge test` green** | ✅ 531/531 across 27 suites (2026-08-27) | us |
| **2 — third-party audit of contracts AND the signer** | ❌ **not started** | external |
| **3 — the launch review** | ✅ **CLEARED 2026-08-13** (founder statement — the whole checklist) | external |
| **4 — Uniswap Labs routing approval for `OmertaHook`** | ❌ **mainnet deploy, explorer verification, submission, and approval pending** | external |

### Gate 2 — the audit

- The current source inventory is enumerated in `CHAIN-DEPLOY.md`. The 2026-08-21
  `CHAIN-AUDIT-PACKET.md` is now a superseded pre-RegistryV2/pre-settlement-pool/pre-O1 snapshot;
  refresh and freeze the packet at the exact release head before an external engagement. Neither
  `StockTokenRegistryV2`, `SettlementGasPool`, nor the O1-only `AcquisitionVault` is authorized for
  production merely because its source and tests exist.
- **Point the auditor at the deleted property.** Until tokenomics v2 step 4, every prior review of
  this suite rested on "nothing mints". That is no longer true — bonds mint — and what replaced it is
  four walls (`dailyCapOMR`, `MAX_DISCOUNT_BPS`, `maxOmrPerEth`, the accretion oracle). An auditor who
  reads the old sentence will review the wrong contract.
- Also brief them on: no oracle on THE BANK's borrow path and no `liquidate()` anywhere (the design's
  central claim, and the class that cost Inverse ~$21M twice); the hook's pool gate (without it anyone
  can emit fabricated revenue wearing a real tx hash); and the accrue-don't-forward rule in both the
  hook and the Alchemist.
- Hand over the 96 indexed audit reports as context, with the standing caveat that they are **point-in-time**
  and `SPEC.md` is what is current.
- **The clock has been reset twice** (v2 step 4; the bond's fourth slice). Do not start it a third
  time with a contract change unless the change is worth the delay.

### Gate 3 — the launch checklist

The checklist is kept **outside this repo** — see the founder. It is the review of every surface that
moves real value. The surfaces it covers are the ones this repo builds chain-dormant and never arms
on its own: treasury stock purchases, transferable TBA drops, the claim rail, NFT proceeds, the
play-pool redistribution, the free community distribution, provenance traits, the activator's leg,
and THE BANK's four (synthetic issuance, yield-bearing deposits, revenue distribution, custody).

**✅ CLEARED 2026-08-13** — the founder states the outside review cleared the WHOLE checklist,
every surface above included. Recorded here as the founder's statement, which is what closes this
gate (the $OMR side had already been recorded cleared 2026-08-12 in `CHAIN-DEPLOY.md`; this widens
it to the full list). **Gate 2 — the security audit — is a different thing entirely and is still
not started: nothing here should be ARMED until it also clears.** A review of whether a surface may
run says nothing about whether the contract holding the money is safe; that is what the audit is for.

### Gate 4 — Uniswap Labs routing

`OmertaHook` uses swap return deltas to collect the quote-currency sell tax, so Uniswap Labs does not
pick it up automatically. Follow `UNISWAP-ROUTING.md`: deploy the final audited implementation on the
supported mainnet early, verify its exact source, initialize the minimally funded static-fee review pool
required by the live form, submit the manual routing form with the full 9% tax, Safe controls, surge, and
anti-snipe disclosure, and record affirmative approval. The CREATE2 miner rejects the separate `0x91…`
address trigger. A hooklist issue improves interface metadata but is not routing approval. Do not seed or
advertise canonical liquidity until a real interface/router smoke test confirms the approved pool is
quoted and settles without custom calldata.

### If gate 2 also goes green — the sequence

`omerta-launch-sequence-design.md` is the plan; `CHAIN-DEPLOY.md` §2 is the exact call order.

- **G-0 pre-flight** — every item there is a gate. Note the snapshot rule: it must be a **historical
  block predating every committed document that names the target communities**, because those targets
  are already enumerated in this repo, so snapshot-before-announce alone no longer closes the farm.
- **G-1 the genesis window (1–3 days)** — bonding at the genesis price on a `GenesisOracle`, throttled
  per day by THE DAILY OFFERING (live). The 120h bond vest outlasts the longest window, so **nobody
  can dump the genesis at the bell, by construction.**
- **G-2 the pool** — pair POL ETH with Safe genesis OMR at the genesis price, deploy the canonical v4
  pool with `OmertaHook`, warm the TWAP one full period, then cut `OmertaBond.setOracle` over to the
  real TWAP. Gate 4 must already be green before the pool is announced. **The cutover is one operation**
  — a gap between them is a bond outage.
- **G-3 the community drop** — snapshot-before-announce, published merkle roots, claims-never-pushes,
  90–180 day window, unclaimed reverts to the Safe.

### Deploy items that fail *silently* — the ones to double-check

Three configuration steps produce a market that looks healthy and is not:

1. **Seed THE BANK's buffer before arming it.** At zero supply the required buffer is zero, so the
   first borrow always passes and every one after it deadlocks. `test_an_unseeded_market_bricks_after_one_borrow`
   pins it.
2. **Set `alchemist.setMintCaps`.** Zero means *unlimited* here — these fail OPEN, unlike
   `maxOmrPerEth` and the gear caps.
3. **Set `dailyCapOMR` on `OmertaBond` and `VoucherClaim`.** Zero means unlimited; with no tranche,
   `dailyCapOMR` is the entire blast radius of a leaked quote-signer.

Plus: **arm the mint last** (`OMR.setMinter(bond)` only after both caps and the oracle hold real
values), and **start the oracle keeper** — `update()` is permissionless and must be poked at least
once per `maxOracleAge` or bonding halts. That failure direction is deliberate, but it makes the
keeper a production dependency; the worker watches it and alerts on `keeper-late` while bonding still
works, which is the lead time.

---

## THE KILL SWITCHES — know these before you need them

| Situation | Switch |
|---|---|
| Supply is being inflated | `OMR.setMinter(address(0))` — one transaction, minting off |
| The sell tax needs to stop | `setSellTax(0,0,0)` — the fee stops, the pool keeps trading. **There is no pause, deliberately:** a hook that can revert `beforeSwap` can halt a public market |
| THE BANK is issuing against a bad sleeve | `Denari.setMinter(0)` — halts issuance **without** touching redemption. The asymmetry is the point: stop issuing before you stop paying |
| A player token is compromised | `POST /v1/mod/revoke` (lighter than a ban) or `POST /v1/auth/logout-all` |
| The game itself | `INVITE_MODE=on` closes the doors without touching anyone already inside |

## WHAT WE ARE DELIBERATELY NOT DOING AT LAUNCH

Written down so it is a decision on the record rather than something that quietly creeps back in.

- **No paid acquisition.** Cold paid traffic into a deep game with a cold start converts terribly, and
  we would be paying to learn what Phase 1 teaches free.
- **No promised chain date.** Two of three gates are external.
- **No earnings, yield, or price messaging.** In any channel, including replies.
- **No leading with crypto.** Segment C is last, by design, and its acquisition motion is the
  community drop rather than a campaign.
- **No new systems until the census says the base is not stuck.** The honest failure mode of a project
  this deep is shipping feature 40 while nobody has found feature 3.

---

## THE ONE-PAGE VERSION

**Ready now:** the game. Every engineering gate is green and verified.

**Blocking Door 1:** four deploy-config items and a launch night. No engineering.

**Blocking Door 2:** nothing — the package is live; populate Door 1 and post.

**Blocking Door 3:** a third-party audit that has not started and six open launch-checklist rows. Neither is
ours to close alone, and neither should hold the game.

**The real risk is not any of the above.** It is launching into a city where nobody meets anybody.
Recruit in cohorts, read the coach census, and watch co-presence rather than headcount.
