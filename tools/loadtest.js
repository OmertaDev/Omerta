// THE CONCURRENCY HARNESS — what happens when many people play at once.
//
// The fourth harness, and it measures the one axis the other three cannot:
//
//   tools/sim.js         — does the economy conserve, and how big is each faucet   (sequential)
//   tools/playthrough.js — what does one person actually experience               (sequential)
//   tools/pgcheck.js     — the node-pg + real-Postgres contract                   (a few pairs)
//   tools/loadtest.js    — MANY PLAYERS AT ONCE                                   (this file)
//
// Why it exists. Every §10.4 proof in this repo is sequential. Conservation under a single actor is a
// weaker claim than it sounds: lost updates, double-spends and torn two-party transfers live entirely
// in the overlap between requests. And production has already shown contention is real — four of one
// player's requests queued on their own character row for 1.0s / 2.1s / 2.3s / 4.3s, which is what
// motivated the D1 lock-free read path. Nobody has ever measured what this game does with 30 people
// in it.
//
// MUST run against real Postgres. pg-mem is single-threaded and implements no row locks, so it cannot
// express contention at all — a green pg-mem run would be evidence of nothing. This refuses to start
// without DATABASE_URL, for the same reason pgcheck does.

// Knobs: LOAD_PLAYERS (30), LOAD_SECONDS (20), LOAD_PVP_BPS (2500 = a quarter of writes are two-party).
//
// THE HEADLINE ASSERTION is §10.4 drift DELTA — measured before the storm and after, and required to
// be zero. Not "drift is zero" (the harness SQL-seeds spending money, so the baseline is non-zero by
// construction), but "the storm did not move it by one cent". A lost update or a double-spend shows up
// there and nowhere else. Everything else the harness prints is diagnosis for when that fails, plus
// the latency and error picture a player would actually feel.

//
// TWO THINGS THAT MATTER, and one that does not.
//
// (1) ZERO deadlocks at every level, including 50 players converging on a handful of victims — 658
//     two-party `withTwoCharacters` lock acquisitions in a 15s run at N=30 alone. The sorted-id lock
//     order holds under real contention. Nobody ever saw a `contention` retry either. This is the
//     result the ~30 red-team passes on lock order were arguing for, now measured instead of reasoned.
//
// (2) The SHAPE is throughput-bound, not lock-bound: req/s is FLAT (~160–180) from 5 players to 50,
//     while latency rises about linearly with player count. That is a saturated queue — the box is out
//     of CPU and requests wait their turn. A lock-contention wall looks completely different
//     (superlinear latency, deadlocks, retries). So the answer to more players here is more CPU, not a
//     locking rewrite. Which of the two it was could not be known without measuring.
//
// (3) The absolute req/s is a property of THIS BOX and means nothing for production — server, database
//     and 50 clients were all competing for the same cores. Do not quote it as capacity.
//
// THE FINDING THIS PRODUCED, AND WHAT IT WAS WORTH. The first run showed `/v1/me` costing ~3× a board
// read uncontended (15ms vs 5ms at N=5) — the most-called endpoint in the game, and `loadOwned` was
// issuing 16 sequential round trips to build it. Folding those into ONE union query, measured with this
// harness on the same box back to back:
//
//                     before      after
//   N=5   req/s          188        246   (+31%)
//         /v1/me p50      14          9   (−36%)
//   N=30  req/s          222        296   (+33%)
//         /v1/me p50      74         47   (−36%)
//         /v1/me p95     175        103   (−41%)
//         board  p50      37         28   (boards call loadOwned too, so they moved as well)
//
// Note the throughput number moved, not just the latency: `loadOwned` runs on EVERY authed request, so
// its round-trip count was a third of the server's total database traffic. That is the value of having
// an instrument — the change was one function, and without measuring it there would be no way to tell
// a real 30% from a plausible-sounding refactor. Run the A/B (stash the change, same box, same run) for
// any future change to this path.
