// THE CHAOS HARNESS — what survives being interrupted.
//
// The fifth harness. The other four all measure a system that is allowed to FINISH:
//
//   tools/sim.js         — does the economy conserve                    (nothing interrupts it)
//   tools/playthrough.js — what one player experiences                  (nothing interrupts it)
//   tools/pgcheck.js     — the node-pg + real-Postgres contract         (nothing interrupts it)
//   tools/loadtest.js    — many players at once                         (nothing interrupts it)
//   tools/chaos.js       — WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMETHING DIES MID-WAY     (this file)
//
// Roughly twenty worker sweeps in this codebase carry a comment claiming they are idempotent, or
// per-row transactional, or safe to re-run. Not one of them has ever been interrupted and then run
// again. "Idempotent" is a claim about a code path that only becomes true when something kills it in
// the middle and the second run is checked — which is what this does.
//
// The other half is the outage the game already had. On 2026-07-25 the API process DIED on every
// database restart (an unhandled Pool 'error' event), and a tester reporting "Internal on every crime"
// was the only signal. That was found by accident. Scenario 3 does it deliberately.
//
// MUST run against real Postgres, and against one this harness is allowed to STOP AND START — it kills
// backends and (optionally) bounces the server. Never point it at anything you care about.
//
//   DATABASE_URL=postgres://…/omerta_chaos JWT_SECRET=x MOD_KEY=yyyyyyyyyyyy \
//     MARKET_SEED='<32 random chars>' SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE=off \
//     PG_CTL='/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_ctl -D /tmp/pgl/d' node tools/chaos.js
//
// PG_CTL is optional: without it scenario 3 (full database restart) is SKIPPED rather than faked, and
// says so. A skipped scenario that announces itself is honest; one that silently passes is the failure
// mode this whole repo keeps finding. (CI skips it — a service container gives no pg_ctl on the
// database host — so scenario 3 only ever runs when someone points this at a local Postgres.)
//
// On a Debian/Ubuntu package install, pg_ctl must run as the postgres user and be told where the
// config lives, which the packaged layout separates from the data directory. A two-line wrapper does
// it, and PG_CTL takes any command, not just a literal pg_ctl:
//
//   printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/sh' \
//     'exec su postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/16/main \
//        -o \x27-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf\x27 $*"' > /tmp/pgctl.sh
//   chmod +x /tmp/pgctl.sh && PG_CTL=/tmp/pgctl.sh npm run chaos
//
// Run it that way before any deploy that touches the pool, a transaction boundary, or db.js. It is the
// only check that exercises the 2026-07-25 outage end to end: the process surviving the database going
// away, 503 rather than 500 while it is gone, and recovery with no redeploy.
