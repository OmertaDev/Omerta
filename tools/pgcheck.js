// correlated-subquery gap, the missing random()), but it is by construction blind to node-pg's own
// contract and to Postgres's real concurrency — and production runs both. On 2026-07-25 that blind
// spot produced, in one night:
//
//   • the API process DYING on every database restart (an unhandled Pool 'error' event)
//   • `loadOwned` issuing 16 overlapping queries on one pooled client (deprecated; removed in pg@9)
//
// Neither was reachable from any pg-mem test. A tester reporting "Internal on every crime" was the
// only signal, and it pointed at the wrong file.
//
// So: boot the real server against real Postgres and assert the things only real Postgres can show.
// Each block below exists because of a specific bug or a specific property that cannot be faked.

// the class is structurally invisible. §7 above cannot see it either, for the same reason one step
// removed — re-applying the CURRENT schema twice means the FIRST application already made the table
// right.
//
// TWO mechanisms stand between us and a repeat, and the mutation pair below establishes which is
// actually doing the work. schema.sql carries HAND-WRITTEN `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`

// every column of every CREATE TABLE, trusting nobody to remember. Measured: disable the deriver
// entirely and this check still passes — 0 statements, every column present — because the
// hand-written blocks currently cover the lot. So the deriver is not today's load-bearing half; it
// is the belt to that discipline's braces, and its whole value is the day somebody forgets.
//
// Which is exactly what this check is for, and it is guarded on that: add an inline-only column to a
