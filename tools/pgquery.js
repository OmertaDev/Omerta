// EVERY QUERY IN THE TREE MUST PARSE ON REAL POSTGRES.
//
// This exists because of a total production outage on 2026-07-30. `loadOwned`'s UNION took `$1` and
// `$2`; Postgres resolves a parameter's type ONCE per statement from how it is used, `$2` was first
// compared to `account_gear.account_id` (TEXT in this schema), and a later branch compared it to
// `rival_events.victim_account` (UUID). `uuid = text` has no operator. The statement did not degrade —
// it failed to PARSE, so every branch died with it, and since loadOwned runs on every authed request
// that was the whole game returning 500 for hours.
//
// All 61 suites passed. They run on pg-mem, which compares uuid to text happily. `tools/pgcheck.js`
// DID catch it — but only because it happens to call `/v1/me`; a query on a path pgcheck does not
// enumerate would still be invisible. That is the gap this closes.
//
// THE MECHANISM: Postgres `PREPARE` does full parse + type resolution and NOTHING ELSE. No rows are
// read, no data is needed, no side effects occur — so every SQL string in `src/` can be checked
// against the real engine in about a second. It catches the whole class, not just the instance:
// uuid-vs-text, misspelled columns, wrong arity, ambiguous casts, UNION type mismatches, bad operator
// resolution. Anything Postgres would refuse at parse time fails here instead of in front of a player.
//
// HONESTY RULE (the one this repo keeps re-learning): a query built with `${...}` interpolation cannot
// be prepared without knowing the interpolated value, so those are COUNTED AND LISTED, never silently
// skipped. A guard that quietly ignores what it cannot read reports a pass over exactly the code it
// failed to check. The count is asserted against a known ceiling so the unreadable set cannot grow
// unnoticed.

// The unreadable set is BOUNDED, not ignored. If a refactor pushes more queries behind variables or
// interpolation, this fails and forces a decision — either make them readable or raise the ceiling
// deliberately, with the reason written down.
// 60 → 63 (2026-08-09): sweepCapoLicense's three dynamic-IN fan-outs (agents → recruits →
// levelled/retained). Dynamic IN lists are the recorded pg-mem posture (`= ANY($1)` returns zero
// rows there), so these are interpolated by necessity; each is parameterized except the IN
// placeholders + two Number()-coerced constants.
// 65 → 66 (2026-08-11): THE BANK's harvest-fee source-membership check, the third instance of the
// same generated-NOT-IN shape — `BANK_SOURCES` is exported and the SQL is built from it, so the
// guard and the declaration cannot drift. (Found by re-running this after the commit that added it
// rather than before, which is ground rule #8's whole point: `npm test` cannot see this class.)
// 63 → 65 (2026-08-09): the money router's two source-membership queries — their NOT-IN lists are
// GENERATED from the exported VIG_SOURCES/TREASURY_SOURCES sets so the check and the declaration
// structurally cannot drift apart (the DESK.SINK_REASONS generated-SQL precedent).
// 66 → 67 (2026-08-11): the family buyback's `community_revenue` source-membership check — the
// FOURTH instance of the same generated-NOT-IN shape, built from the exported COMMUNITY_SOURCES.
// (The keeper's own dynamic-SQL helper was the first cut's OTHER new interpolated site and was
// inlined to literal query() calls instead — a ceiling raise is for shapes that cannot be literal,
// never for ones that merely happen not to be.)
// 67 → 71 (2026-08-14): the backend perf pass added four dynamic-SHAPE queries, each
// placeholder/constant-only with no user input (so injection-safe, but not preparable): honorLeaderboard's
// board helper (`${col}`/`${dir}`/`${cond}` are hardcoded column/direction/predicate strings), the
// /v1/streets fronts scan restricted to a parameterized IN-list of the board's own 100 char ids, and
// persistKitchen's two multi-row `INSERT ... VALUES (...),(...)` batches (placeholders built from the
// row count, values bound). All four are exercised by the suite; none can be literal (the shape is
// dynamic), which is exactly when a ceiling raise is warranted.
// 71 → 72 (2026-08-16, red-team F5): firstsBoard's steward lookup, a per-holder N+1 folded into ONE
// parameterized IN list (`$1,$2,…` built from the holder count, every value bound). Same shape and
// same reason as the /v1/streets fronts scan above — pg-mem returns zero rows for `= ANY($1::text[])`
// (the MY PROFILE lesson), so an IN list is the only portable form, and it is not preparable.
// 72 → 73 (2026-08-16, the deed-vault disclosure): `vaultHistoryFor`'s lookup of what a street's
// on-chain vault has received, an IN list over the deed token ids derived from the names on the board
// (`$1,$2,…` built from the count, every value bound). The SAME shape and the same reason as the two
// above — `= ANY($1::text[])` returns zero rows on pg-mem, so an IN list is the only portable form.
// Worth recording HOW it first showed up: a trailing comment on the `client.query(` line made the
// argument unreadable, so it landed in the *unreadable* bucket instead — counted either way (the
// honesty rule held), but filed under "we couldn't read this" rather than "this is an IN list", which
// is a worse record. The comment moved above the call so it is catalogued as what it actually is.
// 73 → 74 (2026-08-16, the stranded-vault recovery): `strandedDeeds`' street lookup, an IN list over the
// token ids of the pending re-imports (`$1,$2,…` built from the count, every value bound). Same shape
// and same reason as the three above — a read-only operator board, so the alternative (`= ANY`) would
// return zero rows on pg-mem and the board would silently report every stranded deed as nameless.
// 74 → 75 (2026-08-21, the bulletproof batch): `sweepTelemetry`'s keep-list NOT IN — a placeholder
// fan-out over TELEMETRY_KEEP_EVENTS ($2..$n), every value a bound parameter, never a user string.
// 75 → 78 (2026-08-22, THE ANY-OF-ARRAY BAN): three sites converted OFF `= ANY($n)` and onto generated
// placeholder lists — `agentEconomyStats`' withdrawal sum over the agent account ids, and chain.js's
// two `kind IN (…)` filters over VOUCHER_CLAIM_KINDS. The ban exists because `= ANY($1)` binds a JS
// array, which pg-mem answers with ZERO ROWS the moment the filtered column is indexed — silently, so
// the suites pass over a query that found nothing (it took `ix_char_account` landing to expose two
// live referral sites that had read fine for as long as the column was unindexed). The IN form is the
// only portable one and it is not preparable, so the ceiling rises by exactly the three converted
// sites: a raise that BUYS a class of latent bug being enforced away, which is what warrants one.
// 78 → 162 (2026-08-29): NOT a growth event — the count had been drifting past its ceiling for a
// while and the ceiling had never been re-derived, so this raise is the deliberate decision that
// backlog was owed. The set was measured and every one of its 215 interpolated expressions
// classified: 155 match a mechanical safe shape (an engine shim like nowSql()/lockSuffix(), a
// ternary over two string literals, a generated `${n}` placeholder, a numeric coercion, an
// ALL_CAPS module constant) or trace in one level to bindings that all do; the remaining 44 were
// read at their call sites and are a SQL-fragment parameter whose every caller passes a literal, a
// closed-set map key or membership-gated column name, a generated placeholder list, a declared
// migration spec, or a locally-built pagination predicate made only of `$n`. No user string reaches
// SQL text anywhere.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE RAISE DEFENSIBLE is not the audit — AUDIT-red-team-eight lens 3 did exactly that
// sweep by hand at 95 interpolations and it decayed the moment the tree moved. It is that the class
// this guard structurally cannot check now has a guard of its own: THE INTERPOLATION LEDGER
// (test/gates.js) asserts the property the count was only ever a proxy for, catalogue-or-declare,
// and fails BY NAME on an injected user string. The two share one corpus (tools/sqlscan.js) so they
// can never disagree about what the set is. This number bounds how much SQL goes unPREPARED; the
// ledger bounds what can be in it. Neither replaces the other, and the ceiling stays because a
// statement that never reaches Postgres is still a statement nobody type-checked.
// Phase 1 added eight closed-shape query sites. They were not absorbed here: read/lock variants are
// separate static literals, operation participants are locked through bounded sorted single-row
// queries, and the runtime remains inside the existing global ceiling.
