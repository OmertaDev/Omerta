// OMERTÀ progression harness — simulates a REAL PLAYER's first days through the PUBLIC API.
//
// This is the PLAYER-EXPERIENCE twin of tools/sim.js. The sim answers "does the economy conserve
// and how big is each faucet"; this answers "what does a person actually experience" — what they
// can do in a sitting, what's gated, where they STALL with nothing to do, and how long a level takes.
// The level-240 speedrun was a progression bug, not an economy bug: the §10.4 sweep was drift-0 the
// whole time. This harness is how that class gets caught.
//
// THE RULES (same discipline as the sim):
//   • PUBLIC API ONLY. The player is a token; every action is a route call. No SQL shortcuts.
//   • NO VALUE IS SEEDED. Every dollar the simulated player holds was earned through a route.
//   • The only SQL is the CLOCK: advancing the wall clock by pulling this character's timestamps
//     back N minutes. That's the §7.1 lazy-accrual contract — regen and cooldowns are REAL, they
//     just happen in milliseconds.
//   • The player is PLAUSIBLE, not optimal: a fixed priority ladder anyone would follow, not a
//     solver. If a plausible player can speedrun, a real one certainly can.
//
// Run: node tools/playthrough.js            (default schedule)
//      node tools/playthrough.js --days 14  (longer horizon)
// SEASON PIN — the seasonal twist is ARMED in production since 2026-08-02 and its draw follows the
// real calendar (a Crackdown season changes laylow and law-gain; Blood in the Streets changes loot
// and the safehouse). A progression figure that means something different depending on the week it
// was run is not a measurement, so the baseline is pinned. Set SEASON_MOD=<id> to measure a season
// deliberately. Must be set BEFORE the server imports rules.
process.env.SEASON_MOD = process.env.SEASON_MOD || 'dead_quiet';
// …and the PHASE, for the same reason: THE SEASON HAS AN ENDING makes the last week of every
// season discount the turf floor and shorten the windows, derived from the real calendar. A run in
// the reckoning is measuring a different game than a run in week two.

  // age out inside a single run: it measured 99% of advised play, which is precisely what a stuck
  // rung looks like from the outside. The rung is fine — the harness was holding its own watch

// loops is keyed on `dayOf()` rather than on a timestamp — the daily contracts, the corner and its
// chains, the hustle, the trainer drills, the fixture leads and the standing-gain bucket. Warping
// the character's timestamps advances the HOURS but never the DATE, so across a seven-day run the
// player got exactly ONE day of all of it: run A claimed 2 daily contracts in a week, when three a
// day are on offer. Every day-keyed loop was being measured at roughly a seventh of itself, which
// would have read as "these barely move the needle" — a limit of the harness reported as a finding
// about the game. Shifting a stored `day` DOWN is the same trick as pulling a timestamp back: to
// this character, yesterday's row is yesterday's.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: the CONTENT of a day is a seed function of the real `dayOf()`, so the drawn corner
// tasks, hustle stops and drills are the same every simulated day. That is fine for throughput and
// pacing, which is what this harness measures; it is not a test of variety.
// Two kinds, and the difference is the primary key. A table keyed ON the day (one row per day) is a
// LEDGER OF DAYS: shifting every row down one stacks yesterday onto the day before and breaks the
// key — which it did, immediately, on the third simulated day. Those tables get their spent history
// DROPPED and only the live day moved, which is also what the player experiences: yesterday's
