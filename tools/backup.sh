# Nightly Postgres backup. Cron it on the DB host or a worker box:
#   0 4 * * * DATABASE_URL=postgres://... /path/to/tools/backup.sh /backups
# Keeps 14 days of compressed dumps. pg-mem (dev) has nothing to back up.
#
# EVERY VERIFICATION STEP BELOW EXISTS BECAUSE A BACKUP THAT LOOKS FINE AND ISN'T IS WORSE THAN NONE.
# The 2026-07-25 incident made that concrete: Render's managed WAL archiving failed for ~11 minutes
# (pgbackrest archive-push, exit 82, the same segment retried until it gave up) while the dashboard
# and the database itself looked perfectly healthy. The backup chain was severed and nothing said so.
#
# The old version of this script had the same shape of problem. `pg_dump > "$OUT"` writes straight to
# the FINAL filename, so a dump that dies halfway — disk full, connection dropped mid-stream, the
# database restarting under you — leaves a TRUNCATED file sitting there with a plausible name and
# timestamp. `set -e` stops the script, but the corpse stays on disk and the next `ls` looks like a
# healthy backup directory. Nothing ever opened a dump to check it could be read back.
#
# So now: dump to a temp name, VERIFY it, and only then move it into place. A backup only counts once
# something has read it back.

# saying a table is missing when it is present. `rowsOf` below already had to dodge the same class
