// THE POPULATION-SCALE HARNESS — does the SOCIAL economy function with a town in it?
//
// The seventh harness, and it measures the one axis the other six cannot:
//
//   tools/sim.js         — does the economy conserve, and how big is each faucet   (sequential, few)
//   tools/playthrough.js — what does one person experience                          (one player)
//   tools/pgcheck.js     — the node-pg + real-Postgres contract                     (a few pairs)
//   tools/loadtest.js    — many players at once: deadlocks, torn transfers          (concurrency)
//   tools/chaos.js       — what survives being interrupted                          (crash/restart)
//   tools/mobile.js      — do the screens lay out at phone size                     (layout)
//   tools/scale.js       — DOES THE MULTIPLAYER ECONOMY HAVE A COUNTERPARTY         (this file)
//
// Why it exists. Every economic proof in this repo is about one player or about conservation. Neither
// asks the question the whole Risk-to-Earn thesis rests on: with a town's worth of people in the
// city, is there anyone on the OTHER SIDE of a trade? A market with perfect accounting and no
// counterparty is a dead market, and nothing here would have noticed. The progression harness already
// measured the shape of the problem from the other end — a plausible player reaches level 44 and
// $1.9M in seven days having never once interacted with another human.
//
// This drives a POPULATION through a mixed diet of behaviour over warped days, then takes a census of
// every player-to-player market: how many have a live counterparty, how much of what got posted got
// taken, and where the money ended up. It reports rather than prescribes — liquidity numbers are a
// finding for the founder, not a pass/fail. What it DOES assert is the two things that would be bugs
// rather than balance:
//
//   1. §10.4 drift DELTA is zero across the whole run (the loadtest discipline — this harness seeds
//      starting cash so players can reach the markets at all, so the baseline is non-zero by
//      construction; what must not move is the delta).
//   2. Every market is REACHABLE — if a market ends with nobody able to post at all, that is a gate
//      bug, not a quiet town, and it fails.
//
// Runs on pg-mem by default (portable, like sim.js); set DATABASE_URL to drive real Postgres.
// Knobs: SCALE_PLAYERS (36), SCALE_DAYS (5), SCALE_SWEEP (a comma list of populations — runs each and
// prints the DENSITY CURVE, which is what answers "how many people does this game need to feel alive").

// "this is a real deployment"), so without this a real-Postgres run measures the LIMITER instead of

// nothing happened. Every sibling harness that touches a real database does the same (chaos,
// loadtest, pgcheck).
