// THE FAVOR (STREET LIFE step two, task #320) — the PLAYER-posted call.
//
// Step one gave you calls FROM NPC contacts: they ring, you haul, they pay out of their own live
// pocket (recycle-only — nothing is conjured at the point of sale). This is the multiplayer half:
// a PLAYER posts the request, and the people who hold their number can run it.
//
// The one structural difference is the whole reason this is its own file. An NPC's pay is drawn at
// FULFILMENT, so it can quietly evaporate if the NPC gets robbed first (step one voids the request
// and says so). A player's pay is ESCROWED AT POST: the runner who carries six crates across town
// cannot arrive to find the money gone. That escrow is real value parked outside a pocket, so it
// gets the same treatment as every other escrow in the game — its own §10.4 check (`favor escrow`),
// death handling on the loot surface, and a worker sweep that gives it back when nobody runs it.
//
// §10.4 (`favor:` vocabulary + the `favor escrow` check), the market-escrow shape verbatim:
//   favor:post    escrow IN  (poster, negative)
//   favor:pay     the runner's NET (pay − take)
//   favor:take    the 2% carved FROM the pay — NULL character, half street tax, half burns.
//                 Never minted on top, so posting to your own alt is strictly lossy.
//   favor:refund  cancel / expiry — back to the poster
//   favor:loot    a fire-kill takes CASH_LOOT_RATE of a dead poster's open escrow (NULL, the
//                 escrow-side outflow; the killer's matching +row is `whack:loot`)
//   favor:death   whatever the killer didn't take burns (the dead-funder precedent)
//   escrow == posted − paid − takes − refunded − death − loot
//
// Locks: poster/runner via withCharacter (single-party — the poster is never locked while a runner
// fills, because the money is already OUT of their pocket and sitting in the row). The favor row is
// the pot: FOR UPDATE on it serializes two runners racing the same request.
