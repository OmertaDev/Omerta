//
//     cumulative $OMR players can withdraw ≤ cumulative $OMR the Vig bought with real revenue
//
// so extraction can never exceed inflow. We don't build a new safety mechanism — we re-source the
// EXISTING full-reserve withdrawal queue (chain.js) from spender revenue instead of team charity:
// real ETH in → the buyback buys hard $OMR → that $OMR funds the reserve → the queue can only sign
// what the reserve holds. This module does the ACCOUNTING and the INVARIANT; the real DEX swap is
// the mainnet bot's job (dormant until the chain is wired — the M6 pattern). Its DB writes are
// confined to vig_revenue / vig_buyback / vig_prize_pool + (via fundReserve) chain_reserve; real
// ETH and hard $OMR are out-of-band value, OUTSIDE the §10.4 in-game set (zero `transactions` rows
// here — the PLEX bridge, which used to burn IN-GAME $OMR, is retired; see below).

// ── THE PLEX BRIDGE — THE MINT IS ETH ONLY, EVERYTHING ELSE IS PAYABLE IN EARNED $OMR ───────────
// (founder-directed 2026-08-10: "Make the mint ETH only no OMR", then "Make plex items and
// consumables eth only", then — reading the cost that second sweep was flagged with — "maybe we over
// exaggerated on removing everything payable by OMR in Plex".)
//
// THE LINE IS THE BOUND, NOT THE DENOMINATION. That was the rule the mint-only pass drew and the
// second sweep erased; this restores it, because only one of the two arguments for retirement was
// ever about PLEX itself:
//
//   • "A fee payable two ways is always priced by the CHEAPER rail." TRUE, and FATAL for the MINT —
//     minting is the Sybil bound AND the extraction gate, so it is the one price that must never be
//     ambiguous. It is not fatal anywhere else: for a repeatable CONSUMABLE, two rails is a choice
//     of currency, not a bypassed bound. Nothing is gated by how you paid for a revive.
//   • "The $OMR rail stopped burning." True since v3 step 2 (`plex:%` is in `DESK.SINK_REASONS`, so
//     it RECYCLES to the desk shelf, which sells it for ETH at the daily auction). But read again,
//     that is an argument that the two rails are roughly EQUIVALENT — immediate ETH vs deferred ETH
//     through the desk — not an argument for removing one. And it undersells the $OMR rail, which
//     also creates the thing the post-v3 economy most lacks: recurring DEMAND for the token.
//
// WHO ACTUALLY PAYS IN $OMR, stated honestly rather than sold. $OMR has had no faucet since v3 step
// 1, and the mission ladder pays ~1,320 lifetime — nowhere near a respawn at the market rate. So
// this is NOT rent-from-grinding, and sim P9.35 now MEASURES the gap rather than leaving it to a
// comment: the whole earn surface is 1,320 lifetime (the mission ladder, once per account) plus 3/day
// (`daily:all`, a transfer out of the event fund), against 4,118 for the CHEAPEST thing the rail
// sells — 3.1× the entire ladder. So the player who funds their fees in $OMR is the one who takes it
// off somebody: `whack:loot` moves 20–50% of a victim's liquid AND staked $OMR to their killer. That
