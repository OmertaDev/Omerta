// THE CREW (omerta-crew-design.md) — the lightweight 2-4 player mutual-aid pact.
//
// The social scale BETWEEN a lonely solo grind and a 20-person family: opt-in, low-commitment, no
// obligations. It is the on-ramp the progression harness kept landing short of (a plausible solo
// player reaches level 33 having never met another human), and the collective thing the read-only
// Cast/Story/Situation cohesion layer was missing.
//
// It is NOT a new pillar (breadth already exceeds depth). It is connective tissue, scoped to STATUS +
// COORDINATION: a small-group chat room (the missing tier between DM and family), a board of your
// crewmates, and a breakable mutual non-aggression. Deliberately NO treasury, NO turf, NO escrow — so
// **zero §10.4 surface**: nothing in this file moves value or writes a `transactions` row. The
// `crew:` word appears in no ledger vocabulary, and the lifecycle test proves it by counting rows.
//
// ACCOUNT-keyed on every table (`crews`/`crew_members`/`crew_invites`), because a crew is between
// PEOPLE not streets — so it SURVIVES DEATH (the heir stays in the crew), like contacts /
// dynasty_marriages / dm_blocks, and is outside the estate wipe + the migrate DISPOSITION guard by
// construction (that guard matches character-scoped columns; a crew has none).
//
// NON-AGGRESSION is NOT in this file — it is a one-line gate in social/combat.js, co-located with the
// family omertà it parallels (fire/jump/npcHit/shank), reading `h.owned.crewId` /
// `h.victimOwned.crewId` off loadOwned. A crew is mutual RESTRAINT, never immunity: a contract on a
// crewmate's head is still collectable by everyone else, and a rat / WANTED crewmate forfeits the
// shield exactly as they forfeit family omertà.
