// ── src/desk.js — THE DESK (economy v3 steps 2–4: where a spent $OMR goes, and how it comes back) ──
// Design: omerta-economy-v3-design.md §3, §4.2, §11.6, §11.7. A sink used to destroy the token; now it
// hands it to the desk, and the desk sells it back to the market. The whole economic argument in one
// line:
//
//   annual revenue ≈ annual $OMR sink volume × price
//
// so the number that matters is RETURN VELOCITY — how many times a year one token comes home — rather
// than how few tokens exist. You cannot burn AND recycle the same unit; the founder chose revenue,
// which is also why nothing here may be described as deflationary (design §10 risk B).
//
// STEP 2 built the inbound half (the recycle, hooked in `game.js:ledger` so a sink added later cannot
// forget to feed the desk). STEP 3 is the outbound half, and it closes the honest gap that step 2's
// header named out loud: a desk that accumulates and never sells is indistinguishable, from the
// outside, from a burn with extra steps.
//
// ── THE SALE IS A TRANSFER, NOT A MINT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This is the load-bearing §10.4 fact and it is worth stating before any code. The desk sells $OMR it
// already HOLDS: `desk_inventory.balance` goes down by exactly what the buyer's account goes up by,
// and both are inside `omrBuckets`. So conservation needs no new term, no new mint reason, and no new
// burn reason — the identity is untouched because the total did not move. `desk:sale` is written for
// AUDITABILITY (and because it is what makes the vest work — see below), not because conservation
// requires it. That is wall 2 ("the desk never sells inventory it does not hold") holding by
// construction rather than by assertion: there is no code path here that can credit a buyer without
// decrementing the shelf, because it is one clamped subtraction.
//
// ── THE VEST IS ALREADY BUILT, AND THAT IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Design §11.7 asks for a 48h vest on auction purchases. We do not build one. A `desk:sale` credit is
// a positive $OMR row on the buyer's account, and `tax.js:earlySurcharge` replays exactly those rows
// as FIFO lots — so bought $OMR is already priced at the full early-exit surcharge decaying to zero
// over `FRESH_WINDOW_MS`, which is 48h. One concept, one constant: simultaneously the anti-dump, the
// float creator, and the §5(ii) loot exposure window. A second timer beside it would only give the
// two a way to disagree. `test/desk.js` asserts this rather than assuming it.
//
// ── WHY THE FILL COMES IN THROUGH AN INGEST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A purchase is an ETH payment, and ETH arrives on a chain. So the fill follows the M6 pattern every
// other real-value rail here uses (Store, bonds, the sell tax): the backend books an episode that is
// idempotent on a `ref`, and `txHash` marks it REAL. Chain-dormant until the on-chain leg is wired;
// a mod/QA route can drive it meanwhile and books ZERO ETH — "the desk received this much ETH" must
// never be assertable by a comp call. The $OMR side of a comp fill is real (it has to be, or QA is
// testing nothing), which is safe precisely because that side is a transfer.
//
// ── STEP 4 IS THE OTHER EDGE OF THE BAND ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Below `LOWER` the desk RESTOCKS from the open market, funded exclusively by POL trading fees and
// never by minting (design §11.10; that exclusion is wall 4). Its §10.4 shape is the exact inverse
// of a withdrawal — see `runDeskBuyback` below, which is where the argument belongs.
//
// ── LOCK ORDER: accounts → desk_inventory → desk_auctions ──────────────────────────────────────
// The recycle path already holds `account_persistent` (the spend) before it touches `desk_inventory`,
// so a fill that took the shelf first and then reached for the buyer's account would be an AB-BA
// against every sink in the game. Buyer first, shelf second, the auction row last. The buyback takes
// only `desk_inventory` (and `chain_reserve` under it), so it sits inside that same order.

// under-funded` pair now carries the desk's contribution so the reserve's backing sources stay
// enumerated instead of one of them being invisible.
