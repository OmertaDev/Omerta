// THE VOUCH (gap #3 — the positive-sum bond between strangers). Discovery finds people and THE CREW binds
// them, but between "just met" and "crewed up" there was nothing — no lightweight mutual act. THE MENTOR is
// the only positive first-contact and it's asymmetric (veteran → newbie). A vouch is the SYMMETRIC peer act:
// you publicly stake your name on someone ("I know this one — they're solid"), which gives THEM a reputation
// and costs YOU one of a scarce set of slots, so a vouch is a considered endorsement, not noise. If they
// vouch back, that's a MUTUAL bond — the thing the whole cohesion layer (the Cast, the Situation) reads from.
//
// PURE STATUS — a vouch moves no value and writes no ledger row (§10.4-FREE by construction, the test pins
// it). ACCOUNT-keyed both sides → the bond SURVIVES DEATH (the heir keeps who they vouched and who vouched
// them — the crew/marriage/contacts posture; `vouches` is outside the estate wipe by construction). Anti-Sybil
// the hitmen-board way: no payout attaches so a Sybil ring gains nothing tangible, both sides must be a real
// HUMAN (an NPC resident or an agent is neither voucher nor target), and the outbound CAP makes each vouch
// scarce — you only have so many, so spending one means something.
