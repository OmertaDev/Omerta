  // `tools/loadtest.js` measured the cost: `/v1/me` was ~3× a board read (15ms vs 5ms uncontended),
  // which is what a stack of sequential round trips looks like.
  //
  // Two earlier shapes, and why neither survived:
  //   * a `Promise.all` over ONE pooled client — node-pg deprecates overlapping queries on a single
  //     client and REMOVES them in pg@9, and it bought nothing anyway: one connection executes one
  //     query at a time, so pg was silently queueing them. Found by the real-Postgres probe; pg-mem
  //     has no such constraint, so the whole suite was blind to it. `tools/pgcheck.js` now FAILS on
  //     any pg deprecation warning, so that class cannot reach a deploy again.
  //   * sequential awaits — correct, but 16 network round trips to fetch 16 tiny result sets.
  //
  // So: fetch them in a single UNION ALL over a shared narrow shape and demultiplex in JS. The column
  // shape (src, k, k2, n, n2, ts) is padded with typed NULLs — proven to behave IDENTICALLY on pg-mem
  // and real Postgres. `json_agg` was the more obvious encoding and is a trap: pg-mem returns it
  // double-nested (`[[{…}]]` where Postgres gives `[{…}]`), so the suite would have passed over a
  // production bug. `to_jsonb`/`row_to_json` aren't implemented by pg-mem at all.
  //
  // Each group is mapped back to its ORIGINAL column names and types below, so `loadOwned`'s return
  // value is unchanged and no caller needed touching. The explicit `Number()` matters: a `numeric`
  // union column comes back from node-pg as a STRING (precision), where the original `int` columns
  // came back as numbers — coercing here keeps the shape identical instead of relying on all
  // fourteen downstream consumers to keep wrapping.
  //
  // `cars` and `batches` stay separate: both are `SELECT *`, so they do not fit a narrow shape, and
  // `cars` carries an ORDER BY that callers rely on.
  // EVERY null is cast, in EVERY branch — not just the first. pg-mem unifies UNION column types
  // PAIRWISE LEFT-TO-RIGHT and types a bare `NULL` as text, so a branch carrying a timestamp followed
  // by a branch with an untyped NULL in that position fails with "UNION types timestamp with time zone
  // and text cannot be matched". Postgres infers from the first branch and does not care. A 4-branch
  // spike passed precisely because its timestamp branch happened to be LAST — the shape only breaks at
  // the point where an untyped NULL follows a typed value. Casting everywhere removes the dependence on
  // either engine's inference rules, which is the only version that is safe to rely on.
  //
  // AND THE SAME LESSON A SECOND TIME, THE HARD WAY — `$3` IS `$2` AGAIN, DELIBERATELY.
  // Postgres resolves a PARAMETER's type once for the whole statement, from how it is used. `$2` is
  // first compared to `account_gear.account_id`, which this schema declares TEXT — so `$2` is text
  // everywhere, and `rival_events.victim_account = $2` is `uuid = text`, for which no operator exists.
  // The statement does not degrade: it fails to PARSE, so every branch of the union dies with it, and
  // since loadOwned runs on every authed request that is the entire game returning 500. pg-mem compares
  // uuid to text happily, so all 61 suites passed over a total production outage.
  //   The schema's account ids are genuinely mixed (28 text columns, 12 uuid), which is the underlying
  // defect; changing a live column's type is not an outage fix. So the uuid-typed branch gets its OWN
  // parameter carrying the SAME value: `$3` is inferred uuid from its only use, `$2` stays text, and
  // `ix_rival_events_victim` is still usable — casting the COLUMN instead (`victim_account::text=$2`)
  // would also parse but would throw the index away. Any future branch joining on a uuid-typed account
  // column must bind $3, not $2. `tools/pgquery.js` fails the build if this regresses.

    // comes back `400 no_character — "Create a character first."` to a player whose heir is
    // standing right there. It is not a logic bug, it is READ COMMITTED: a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`
    // that BLOCKS on the dying row re-evaluates its WHERE against the NEW row version when the
    // killer commits — `alive` is now false so the row drops out — and the heir INSERTed by that
    // same commit is not in this statement's snapshot, so it is not picked up either. Zero rows.
    //
    // It fires at the worst moment (the client refreshes ON the `whacked` event, straight into the
    // window) and it LIES in the way this codebase has now corrected three times: an ordinary game
    // state reported as a broken one. `boot()` renders any non-2xx as THE LINE'S DEAD, so a player
    // who reloads there is told the city's records are unreachable; an agent is told to create a
    // character it already has. No suite can see it — pg-mem is single-caller.
    //
    // The remedy for the artifact is simply to look again: a second statement takes a fresh
    // snapshot and finds the heir. Nothing has happened in this transaction yet (this is its first
    // statement), so re-running is clean, and an action in flight when you die lands on your heir —
    // exactly as if it had been clicked a moment later, with every gate still applying. Only a
    // genuinely characterless account reaches the throw.
    //
    // THE CLASS WAS SWEPT, and this is its only instance (RT#7's rule — a class fixed only where it
    // was discovered is half-fixed). ~40 other `FOR UPDATE` selects in src/ carry a MUTABLE predicate
    // and could take the same artifact; every one is fail-safe, in three shapes. (a) The zero-row
    // answer is simply TRUE — the target really is dead (`id=$1 AND alive`), the lot really did
    // settle (`status='live'`), the pot really did expire (`expires_at > now()`) — so a correct
    // refusal, and a false negative is impossible: a blocker that rolls back leaves the pre-image,
    // which the re-evaluation sees. (b) The zero-row path PARKS the value rather than dropping it
    // (store.js's wire days → `wire_pending_days`, applied at the heir's birth). (c) It rolls back
    // with nothing consumed (mintCharacter/rerollCharacter leave the paid credit on the ACCOUNT, so
    // a retry works), or it is a worker sweep whose skipped row comes round again next tick. What
    // made THIS one a defect rather than a message is that withCharacter is the wrapper every authed

// A pure-read GET does not need the write lock — but it cannot simply skip accrual either, because
// §7.1 accrual is GAMEPLAY, not bookkeeping: it fires the Bureau raid, which sets jail_until. Reads
// are what land that on an idle player. Two earlier designs tried to make reads never persist and
// both were rejected on measurement (see SPEC.md D1) — pg-mem implements no SAVEPOINT syntax at all,
// and pg-mem's ROLLBACK is a no-op, so a "roll the action back and re-settle" scheme applied accrual
// twice and drifted §10.4 in every suite while passing them.
//
// So this takes the cut that needs neither: accrue IN MEMORY with no lock, then look at what moved.
//
//   • Nothing moved  → there is nothing to persist. Return having taken NO lock and written NOTHING.
//   • Something moved → hand off to withCharacter, which re-reads under FOR UPDATE and behaves
//                       exactly as it always has, raid included.
//
// Every outcome is therefore either "changed nothing, wrote nothing" or "the audited path, verbatim".
// There is no third behaviour to reason about, no new schema, and no new failure mode.
//
// This is aimed squarely at the measured symptom: production showed four of ONE player's requests
// queued on their own row for 1.0s/2.1s/2.3s/4.3s. Requests that close together are precisely the
// case where accrue() hits its one-second early return and does nothing — so exactly the traffic that
// was piling up stops taking the lock. A read after a real gap still takes it, and is no worse than
// before. (A compare-and-swap could make even those lock-free; it needs a version column, because
// last_accrued_at round-trips through node-pg at millisecond precision and would never match
// Postgres's microseconds. Left for later — this cut carries the measured win without that risk.)

// 40P01 retry would merely paper over. So the debit runs behind `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`: a
// contended mark is simply SKIPPED and the faucet pays the whole take, which is an independently
// correct outcome, so the fallback costs the player nothing.
