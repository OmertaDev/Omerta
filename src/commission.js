// THE COMMISSION (design: omerta-commission-design.md). The top-SEATS families by standing vote
// weekly on a city decree; the majority of week W−1's votes governs week W, tallied LAZILY by
// whoever asks (no ticks). One family one vote, changeable all week, and votes are PUBLIC — the
// politics is the content. Step two (audit-hardened): a ballot stamps the family's STANDING at
// cast time (re-casting refreshes it); the tally ranks the week's FROZEN ballots by that stamp,
// counts only the top SEATS of them, and derives the weights (head = SEATS … last = 1) from the
// rank — so the electorate is bounded at the seat count no matter how many families transited
// the table mid-week, stale "I held the head seat for a minute" ballots rank where they belong,
// and the result never moves once the week freezes. A dissolved family's ballots die with it
// (social.js removeMember). The head seat's BOSS may VETO the sitting decree once per week, on
// the public record. No decree moves money: effects are bounded one-week modifiers applied at
// exactly one touchpoint each (safehouse / declareWar / laylow / convoy defense).
