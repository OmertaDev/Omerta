// ═══ THE TREASURY — the ETH vault, and (since 2026-08-10) the stock reserve beside it ═══
// This file was `rwa.js`, THE FLOAT: ETH slices accumulated, a bot bought real tokenized stock, and
// players burned earned $OMR to claim allocation from it. The founder retired the STOCK half on
// 2026-07-31 and directed that **the vault stays and is BACKED WITH ETH** instead — then REOPENED
// stock acquisition on 2026-08-10 (`omerta-brokers-design.md`) to fund a play-weighted distribution
// to NFT holders. Both halves now live here, and the distinction between them is the whole file:
//
//   THE VAULT is the PLAYER rail — burn $OMR, get an ETH allocation. It is ETH on both sides and
//   stays that way; a player's claim is never denominated in stock, so the game is never in the
//   position of owing a claim in one asset while holding another.
//   THE STOCK RESERVE is a separate obligation to NFT holders, in units, with its own per-ticker
//   wall. It touches the vault at exactly one point — the ETH it spends is ETH the vault can no
//   longer promise — and that point is `heldAndAllocated`'s spend term.
//
// WHY THAT IS THE STRONG VERSION, NOT THE WEAK ONE. The float rested on `allocated <= held`: the
// game only ever owes what it already holds, and price movement can never create a shortfall. That
// property works ONLY while both sides of the ledger are the SAME asset. Backing a STOCK-denominated
// claim with ETH would have broken it twice over — it turns handing over an asset you own
// into a cash-settled payout on one you do not, and mechanically the treasury goes short exactly when
// players claim. Denominating BOTH SIDES in ETH restores the original wall EXACTLY: the game only
// ever owes ETH it already holds, and there is no second asset to diverge from.
//
// WHAT THE RETIREMENT DELETED, AND WHAT THE REOPENING BRINGS BACK. The retirement removed the buy
// bot, the per-ticker reserve, the stock oracle and the price-continuity bound — and with them the
// only gated surface in the project. The 2026-08-10 reversal brings back the reserve and the wall
// (below), and the keeper (design step 5) with them; `rwa_reserve`/`rwa_buys` stayed gone, because
// the new tables are `stock_buys`/`stock_allocations` and HELD-in-ETH is still just the inflow
// ledger. The gate came back too, and §6 of the brokers design is where it is
// recorded rather than here.
//
// WHAT IT IS, PRECISELY. An ALLOCATION ledger, exactly as the float was: a claim moves ETH from the
// treasury's unallocated pool into the player's account-level line. **Nothing here delivers ETH to a
// player** — no transfer, no withdrawal, no on-chain path; the ETH VAULT is allocation-only by design.
// STOCK delivery, by contrast, IS built (chain-dormant) in `stockdeliver.js` (brokers §3.4,
// founder-directed 2026-08-14): owed stock is pushed into the player's on-chain STREET DEED's ERC-6551
// token-bound account via StockVault. `delivered <= allocated` (per ticker, units) is added to
// `runTreasuryInvariants` below as that rail's own wall.
//
// The four slices keep their bps and their sources (Store 20% / gameplay fees FEE_TREASURY_BPS / the
// DEX sell tax's SELL_TAX.RWA_BPS / bond ETH's BONDS.RWA_BPS). The table is still named
// `rwa_revenue`: renaming it is migration risk for no benefit, and it is the treasury's inflow ledger.
//
// Out-of-band real value: ZERO §10.4 rows beyond the `rwa:vault` $OMR burn, which rides the existing
// `rwa:%` vocabulary (so invariants.js needs no change). R1 — the Portfolio (`portfolio.js`) — is
// UNTOUCHED: it was always pure in-game status with a deterministic §7.11 hash price, no sell and no
// cash-out, and it stays exactly that.

// The claim is ETH-for-$OMR, so there is exactly one price: OMR per ETH, from the latest Vig buyback
// (mainnet: the DEX TWAP). There is no second, externally-quoted asset price to manipulate — that
// whole surface went with the stock.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED, because this price now moves REAL ETH out of the treasury's unallocated pool. A stale
// or absent price is a free option: claim at yesterday's rate and keep the difference. So:
//   - no print, or a print older than ORACLE_MAX_AGE_MS  →  the vault REFUSES. It does NOT fall back
//     to `STORE.PLEX_FLOOR_OMR_PER_ETH`. That floor is fine for quoting a fixed-price SKU pre-market;
//     using it to price a claim on real ETH would mean "we don't know what ETH costs" resolves to
//     "sell it at the default", which is the whole hole.
//   - the price a claimer pays carries CLAIM_PREMIUM_BPS over spot. The vault is not a market maker;
//     handing ETH out at exactly the market price makes every claim a risk-free skim on whichever
//     side the oracle happens to lag.
// `stale` is returned rather than thrown so the BOARD can render an honest "closed" state while the
// CLAIM refuses — one source of truth for both.

// revenue. The $OMR side is a SINK, not destruction: `rwa:%` is in DESK.SINK_REASONS, so the claim's
