// = bigger reward each, capped), settled at the window's CLOSE by the worker so everyone gets the final
// count — the boxing-main-event / tournament settle pattern. On an `honor` night the reward is a

// −1, CAP), once/day per street, level-floored, agent-excluded). `honor` nights write no ledger row.
