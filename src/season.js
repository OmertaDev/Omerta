// THE SEASON HAS AN ENDING — the arc over the 28-day season.
//
// The strategy package gave the game scarcity (which holdings, when, how much, who). This gives it
// an ARC. Before this, every system ran forever at the same tempo and a season RESET rather than
// CONCLUDED — nothing expired, nothing was decided, no position was ever cashed out. Strategy gets
// most of its tension from a clock that makes "not yet" cost something, and there was no clock a
// player could see.
//
// Three parts, and only the first two are in this file:
//   1. THE CLOCK   — a published phase (opening / long game / reckoning) with the days left, so a
//                    player can plan against a deadline. `seasonPhaseOf` in rules.js.
//   2. THE ESCALATION — the reckoning's three touchpoints, which live at their own sites in
//                    social/gangs.js (contest window, turf floor, watch window). All pacing/price,
//                    all turf, NONE a faucet: the last week makes the map cheap to fight over and
//                    fast to settle; it never pays more.
//   3. THE RECKONING — this file's `recordReckoning`, called from the worker's rollover: one row
//                    per closed season naming who ended it on top, and a crown on the champion's
//                    bloodline. PURE STATUS, zero §10.4 — nothing is reset or seized. That is the
//                    deliberate call: a wrecking-ball ending is wrong for a thin alpha, and a crown
//                    plus a permanent record gives the arc without one.
