// ── THE TWO DEX BOTS — the real on-chain legs of the buyback + protocol-owned liquidity ──
//
// CHAIN-DEPLOY's still-owed pair, built 2026-08-15:
//
//   1. THE DEX BUYBACK BOT (`runDexBuyback`) — the real TWAP source that replaces the manual
//      `mod/vig/buyback` price. It swaps unspent Vig revenue (real ETH) for hard $OMR on the
//      canonical Uniswap v4 pool, then reports the ACHIEVED price into the audited
//      `runVigBuyback(pool, { priceOmrPerEth, maxEth })` — so every wall that function carries
//      (the vig_prize_pool singleton lock, the VIG_MAX_PRICE_JUMP continuity wall, the
//      `ethToSpend ≤ unspent revenue` root cap, the RESERVE_BPS split, fundReserve) applies to the
//      bot's fills exactly as it did to the manual price. The bot ADDS the walls only reality can
//      supply: the price comes from the SAME oracle the bond reads (resolved from
//      `OmertaBond.oracle()` — the bondOracleHealth posture, no new address env to drift),
//      fail-closed on no/zero/stale readings (the OmrTwapOracle discipline — no fallback price,
//      ever), and the swap carries a hard `minOmrOut` slippage floor derived from that reading.
//
//   2. THE POL-PAIRING BOT (`runPolPairing`) — pairs the bonded ETH into the OMR-ETH pool as
//      protocol-owned liquidity. `OmertaBond` forwards each bond's POL slice to `polRecipient`
//      in-tx (the bot wallet holds the ETH); `bond_reserve.pol_eth` is the BOOK of what arrived.
//      The bot pairs that ETH with $OMR at the oracle price into a full-range v4 position — and
//      the root cap is the book: Σ real pairings ≤ pol_eth booked, so the bot can never pair ETH
//      the bond programme did not deliver. The $OMR side comes from the bot wallet's own hard OMR
//      (Safe-allocated genesis supply — NEVER in-game supply, nothing here mints).
//
// TWO-PHASE SWAP-THEN-BOOK (the stage→confirm discipline, stockdeliver's shape): a real swap is
// JOURNALED in `dex_swaps` (idempotent on the tx hash) the moment it fills, and BOOKING it into
// runVigBuyback is a separate step that reads unbooked journal rows — so a crash between the swap
// and the accounting loses nothing (the next run books the orphan WITHOUT re-swapping), and a
// booking refusal (a concurrent manual buyback consumed the revenue) is NAMED (`booked_short`),
// never silent. POL pairings journal the same way (`pol_pairings`); there is no booking leg —
// the journal IS the books, and the root cap sums it.
//
// §10.4: ZERO SURFACE BY CONSTRUCTION. Everything here is out-of-band real value (the fees.js
// precedent): journal rows, bond_reserve reads, and the runVigBuyback call — whose own writes
// (vig_buyback, the prize pool singleton, fundReserve → chain_reserve) were audited long ago and
// write no `transactions` rows either. The suite pins the whole flow to zero ledger rows.
//
// CHAIN-DORMANT until configured (the delivery-keeper pattern): the buyback needs CHAIN_RPC_URL +
// OMERTA_BOND_ADDRESS (the oracle resolver) + DEX_BOT_PK + UNIVERSAL_ROUTER_ADDRESS + OMR_ADDRESS
// + OMERTA_HOOK_ADDRESS; POL pairing swaps UNIVERSAL_ROUTER for POSITION_MANAGER_ADDRESS. Every
// skip is NAMED (the community-keeper no_budget lesson — silence reads as fine), the RPC senders
// sit behind `__set*` seams so the orchestration + walls + accounting are fully testable, and the
// wrong-chain guard applies to every sender (a colliding deploy on another chain must refuse).
//
// THE v4 ENCODINGS ARE PROVEN (2026-08-16) — `npm run dexbot-e2e` (tools/dexbot-e2e.js) stands up a
// REAL Uniswap v4 (actual PoolManager / PositionManager / StateView / Universal Router / Permit2
// bytecode) on anvil, initializes the canonical OMR/ETH pool behind the REAL OmertaHook, and runs
// both bots with their senders UNSEAMED, so the encoders below build the calldata that executes.
// This header used to say the opposite, and the run is what closed it — 18 asserted steps.
//
// It found a real one, and it is the reason a fork test earns its keep over a careful reading: the
// mint over-sent ETH and v4 NEVER refunds it. `DeltaResolver` settles native ETH out of the
// PositionManager's own balance, so the unused remainder simply stays there, unreachable by anyone.
// Over-sending is the ORDINARY case rather than an edge — the OMR side is priced at the oracle
// while the liquidity is derived from the pool's live sqrtPrice, and a TWAP lags spot by design —
// so at a 15% oracle-vs-spot gap the run measured 0.148 ETH of 1 ETH LOST, in bonded POL money,
// with the journal still booking the full 1 ETH as paired. Both halves are fixed below (a SWEEP
// action, and booking what the position actually consumed) and both are mutation-pinned.
//
// The seamed suite (`test/dexbot.js`) remains where the orchestration, walls, journals and §10.4
// posture are asserted; the fork run is for the bytes.

//
// It needs NO bot key: `lpReaderReady()` is deliberately a weaker condition than
// `polPairingReady()`, so the league can be armed on a box that never sends a transaction.
//
// ENUMERATION is the poolId-filtered `ModifyLiquidity` stream, not a scan of every token the
// PositionManager ever minted. v4's PositionManager passes `bytes32(tokenId)` as the position
// SALT and PoolManager indexes that event by poolId, so ONE filtered getLogs yields exactly the
// tokenIds that ever held liquidity in OUR pool — on a PositionManager that may serve hundreds of
// others. Current liquidity and current owner are then read from the PositionManager itself
// rather than replayed from the deltas: the authoritative value beats a sum we maintain. The
// PoolManager address is resolved from the PositionManager's own `poolManager` getter (the
// `OmertaBond.oracle()` posture — one less address env to drift out of step with the deploy).
//
// THE DEPTH MATH is `addLiquidityOnchain`'s mint in reverse — amount0 for liquidity L over
// [tickLower, tickUpper] at the live sqrtPrice — and it deliberately does NOT treat every position
// as full-range. That shortcut needs no tick math at all (amount0 ≈ L/√P) and would make the
// metric GAMEABLE: a narrow range carries a far larger L for the same tokens, so concentration
// alone would inflate reported depth. The real formula prices a position by what it would actually
// hand over at today's price, which is the thing the league claims to measure.
//
// √ratio(tick) is computed as 1.0001^(tick/2) in floating point rather than by porting TickMath's
// twenty-constant chain. A double carries ~16 significant digits across the entire legal tick
// range (√ratio spans 5.4e-20 … 1.8e19), which is orders of magnitude finer than a status ladder
// can read — and it is a formula a reviewer checks by eye, where a mistyped magic constant is
// invisible. `tools/dexbot-e2e.js` pins it two independent ways: against the ETH a real position
// actually consumed (a wallet balance delta, measured, not derived), and against the pool's own
// reported tick.
