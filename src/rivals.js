// THE RIVALS LEDGER — who has shown you malice (omerta-street-rivals-design.md §3).
// Pure intel over events the victim already WITNESSED: zero §10.4 surface (nothing here moves
// value), and the info-economy rule is load-bearing — recordRival is called ONLY from acts whose
// existing notify already NAMES the aggressor to the victim (jump, shakedown, rob, car theft,
// hostile takeover, a fire-kill). It must never reveal what the game hides: anonymous contracts,
// NPC-hit payers and wiretaps stay hidden; the $OMR peek/trace stay the only piercers.
//
// ACCOUNT-keyed on BOTH sides (the vendetta/dm_blocks posture): malice follows the bloodline —
// your heir remembers who robbed you, and the aggressor's heir carries the name. No character_id
// column, so the estate wipe never touches it by construction; the CURRENT living street on each
// side is resolved at read (the feud-ledger pattern).

// at all, so a naive savepoint-first version silently recorded NOTHING under the whole suite —
// there the bare insert runs instead (safe: pg-mem doesn't poison a txn on a failed statement).
