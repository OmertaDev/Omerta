// THE BLOCK — one read for the streets screen, the one players spend the most time on.
//
// The Home aggregate took the landing screen from 19 requests a tick to 5, which left STREETS as the
// worst at 9 — and streets is where a player actually lives, so it is the largest remaining share of
// what one idle player costs. `src/aggregate.js` carries the argument and the isolation mechanics;
// this file is the MAP.
//
// WHY `/v1/block` AND NOT `/v1/streets/...`. `/v1/streets` is already the ROSTER — the list of people
// you can act on — and it is a different thing from the screen's own boards. Hanging the aggregate
// under it would put two unrelated meanings on one path, and the roster is not even one of the boards
// folded in here. The block is where the corner, the day's work and the gym are.
//
// TWO OF THESE DO NOT GO THROUGH `readCharacter`, and both are deliberate:
//   · `/v1/market/prices` is KEYLESS and read-only. Prices come from the seed; available shop stock
//     and demand come from the shared liquidity counters on the same read client.
//   · `/v1/daily` reads through the pool rather than `readCharacter`. `getDaily` is two SELECTs and
//     writes nothing, and it takes its querier as an argument — so handing it the request's own
//     client is both correct and stricter than the route it mirrors, since that client is the one
//     that refuses writes.
