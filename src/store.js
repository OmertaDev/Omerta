// grant ONLY non-§10.4 things — entitlements (mint_credit / respawn_token), access windows
// (pass_until / wire_until), and status (patron). So §10.4 is UNTOUCHED by construction: this module
// writes ZERO `transactions` rows (the entitlements it grants are already out-of-band, the fees.js
// precedent). The only real-value accounting is the three-way revenue split (out-of-band, like
// vig_revenue): founder profit / $OMR buyback flywheel / RWA reserve (R2, dormant). The ETH itself
// went to the dev wallet ON-CHAIN via the OmertaFees tollbooth — the backend never custodies it.
//
// Isolation: this module writes only store_payments / store_grants / rwa_revenue / vig_revenue and
// the entitlement columns on account_persistent (+ the wire_until access window on the living
// character). The chain layer (a StorePaid watcher) is DORMANT — until it ships, the mod comp route
// and the test drive recordStorePurchase directly (the test/chain.js fee precedent).

// ── PLEX-for-packages: pay a Store SKU from EARNED $OMR instead of ETH ──────────────────────────
// (founder-directed 2026-08-10, after the full retirement was pulled back to the mint alone: "maybe
// we over exaggerated on removing everything payable by OMR in Plex".)
//
// THE LINE IS THE BOUND, NOT THE DENOMINATION (see the same note in vig.js). A Store SKU is a
// consumable, an access window or cosmetic status — none of it gates anything, so which currency
// paid for it changes nothing about what it does. The one exception is absolute and is enforced
// below rather than remembered.
//
// The retirement's Store-specific argument was that a $OMR purchase routes around the four-way
// revenue split, and that half is TRUE: the four destinations get no wei today. What it left out is
// where the $OMR goes — since v3 step 2 `plex:%` is in `DESK.SINK_REASONS`, so it recycles onto the
// desk shelf and is sold for ETH at the daily auction. So the split is DEFERRED and re-routed
// through the desk, not skipped; and against that the rail buys the thing the post-v3 economy most
// lacks, which is a recurring reason to want the token at all.
//
// THE MINT IS THE EXCEPTION, and closing it is a real fix rather than a restoration. Before the full
// retirement, `payPlex('mint')` refused while the `made_man` SKU — which grants the same mint credit
// — was still PLEX-payable, so the ETH-only mint had a $OMR door standing open beside it. That is
// exactly the cheaper-rail hole the mint rule exists to prevent, routed around one layer up. No
// $OMR rail may produce a mint credit, checked on the GRANT rather than on the sku name so a new
// SKU cannot reopen it by being spelled differently.
//
// `made_man` itself is now RETIRED outright (see RETIRED_PACKAGES) — closing its $OMR door only to
// leave it selling the same credit for a hardcoded 0.01 ETH would have swapped a $OMR cheap-rail for
// an ETH one that did not move with MINT_TRANCHES. The grant guard below STAYS despite there no
// longer being a SKU that trips it: it is the wall, not the patch, and the whole point of checking
