  //   - It cannot be sold, gifted or laundered, which is exactly what made the $OMR version a

  // — you are dragging a family out of bed, and that takes more muscle than a fight they came to.
  //
  // Deliberately a PREMIUM, not a LOCKOUT (the EVE window, softened for a small alpha). A hard
  // window would make turf untakeable 20 hours a day and stall the whole war loop in a thin
  // population; a premium keeps every hour playable while making WHEN a real decision on both
  // sides — the holder picks a window they will actually be online for (attacks concentrate where
  // they can answer), the attacker chooses between the plain price and paying to catch them cold.
  // §10.4: it scales the EXISTING `turf:seize:` treasury sink — no new reason, no new faucet.

  // SEIZE_OUTBID), done. No simultaneous decision, no bluff, no commitment — the attacker always
  // moved last with perfect information and the holder never moved at all.
  //
  // A PLAYER-HELD district now changes hands ONLY through a sealed contest: every family commits a
  // SECRET stake from the treasury, the highest commitment takes the district when the window
  // closes, and the holder wins ties (the defender's advantage). Unheld and NPC-occupied districts
  // still fall to an outright claim — there is nobody on the other side to contest with, and an
  // instant buyout CANNOT coexist with a sealed contest on the same district (if the district is
  // purchasable at price P, nobody bids above P and the contest is theatre).
  //
  // CONTEST_LOSS_BPS is what makes it a real sealed bid rather than "always commit everything": a
  // loser gets the rest back but forfeits this share, so over-committing against a family that was
  // never coming costs you money. Escrowed at stake time, so a bid is a COMMITMENT — you cannot

  // so your best cunning can keep the Bureau off your operations OR keep the pad cheap, never both.
  //
  // The teeth are the LIVE gate, not the numbers: a post only counts while its holder is alive,
  // out of lockup and out of the hospital. Kill or jail a family's Enforcer and their turf gets
  // cheaper to take until they put somebody else in the chair — which costs them that man's post
  // elsewhere. That is what makes this strategy rather than a settings screen: the existing PvP

  // is too low — five kills to break even on a purchase, assuming you can even find a holder. But a
  // flat 0.50 fails the OTHER way: too high and holding is suicide, so nobody carries a float and
  // there is nothing to loot. Both failure modes end with the extraction path dead.
  //
  // The move is that EXPOSURE IS PROPORTIONAL TO IDLENESS, NOT TO WEALTH. $OMR sitting doing nothing
  // is dead capital that suppresses velocity — the one KPI. $OMR committed to a purpose is already
  // working, and the commitment is itself a cost. So:
  //
  //   IDLE      (a loose balance, and everything fresh — bonded, bought at the desk, just unbonded)
  //             → OMR_LOOT_IDLE. Hoarding is the punished behaviour.
  //   COMMITTED (an access stake — §11.5) → OMR_LOOT_COMMITTED. Already working; less exposed, NEVER safe.
  //
  // Three consequences worth naming. It gives a holder a genuine choice with a real tradeoff (commit
  // and be safer, or stay liquid and be a target) and BOTH answers help — committing drives velocity,
  // staying liquid feeds the hunters. It makes whales the rational prey and automatically protects a
  // new player (a fresh street holding nothing is worth nothing to hunt) with no rule required. And it
  // is self-balancing: as whales learn to commit, typical scores fall and hunters must hunt more.
  //

// ── THE PACING BLOCK (founder-directed 2026-07-24, from live alpha) ────────────────────────────
// An alpha tester reached LEVEL 240 in a couple of hours. The diagnosis (measured, not guessed):
//
//   1. `train` had NO cooldown and NO cash cost — 10 energy against a 40/min regen = ~240 sessions
//      an hour, so every mission STAT gate (muscle/cunning/speed up to 155) fell in one sitting.
//   2. MISSIONS had no cooldown either, and the ladder SELF-UNLOCKS: from ~m6 on, each mission's
//      respect reward overshoots the NEXT mission's level gate by 30–100 levels, so once the stats
//      were up all 28 could be claimed back-to-back.
//   3. The ladder pays **239,200 respect** end to end, and `levelOf` needed only 228,484 for L240.
//      The mission chain alone WAS levels 1→245; the rest of the game never entered into it.
//
// For scale: the best sustained crime grind is ~3,257 respect/hr, so the ladder handed over
// roughly three days of hard grinding in one uninterrupted sitting.
//
// Every dial the fix uses lives here so the whole pacing curve is one block to tune. NOTE:
// `levelOf` reads LEVEL_DIVISOR from here — a deliberate founder override of the prototype's `/4`
// (the D5 bank-taper precedent). It is defined in THIS file, the half the extractor never opens, so
// a regeneration cannot clobber it and there is nothing to re-apply by hand. (This comment used to

// `jailed` / `hospitalized` / `safeHoused` are the gates almost every verb in the game consults, and
// they were defined in `src/social/shared.js` — the SOCIAL package's leaf. That reads fine from inside
// social/, and wrong from `portfolio.js` or `estate.js`, so sixteen sites outside that package wrote
// the date comparison INLINE instead of reaching across. Each copy was correct; the hazard is that a
// copy cannot be updated by fixing the helper, and the forgotten-gate class is this project's most
// productive bug family (jump vs fire, collectFrontier vs collectTerritory, npcHit blind to the Pen
// shields). So the definitions move to the universal leaf beside their five siblings — `penSafe`,
// `inHole`, `witproActive`, `crewCold`, `isMade` — which every module already imports, and
// `social/shared.js` re-exports them so its ~100 existing call sites are untouched.
//
// Behaviour is byte-identical: `ch.jail_until && new Date(ch.jail_until) > new Date()` and
// `!!ch.jail_until && new Date(ch.jail_until).getTime() > now` agree on every input, since Date
// comparison with `>` coerces through valueOf() — the same number getTime() returns. The `now`

  // instinct. **A false halt is cheap; a loose bound is expensive** — and asymmetrically so:
  //   • bound fires wrongly → the keeper skips an epoch and a human looks. The ETH is still there.
  //   • bound is too loose  → real ETH buys few units, permanently, and NO INVARIANT CATCHES IT:
  //     `allocated ≤ held` is in UNITS, so buying few units for much ETH leaves every wall true.
  // So the bound is deliberately NOT sized to accommodate every honest move. A first cut scaled it
  // with the gap since the last print (`BASE^sqrt(Δ/epoch)`) and had to be thrown away — it yields
  // 6.7× at a month and 26.7× at a quarter, and a 26× bound is a formality with a comment attached.
  // Bound the ORDINARY case; let the extraordinary one stop the bot and fetch a human.
  //
  // The bounded quantity is stock/ETH, a RATIO, so ETH's volatility sets it even for a blue chip:
  // a "calm" large-cap still moves ~4.7%/day against ETH. 2× covers 3σ over an epoch (1.57×) and an

// decision it was blocking: a `PoolKey` holds exactly ONE hook address, and TWO hooks wanted the
// canonical OMR/ETH pool — this one (an afterSwap cut of every swap's ETH leg → the Vig) and
// `OmertaHook`'s four-slice SELL TAX (dev / treasury / LP / vig). They cannot both serve it. The
// sell tax wins on three counts: it is the one the money router already declares end to end, it
// taxes SELLING rather than all trading (so it never prices the buy side of the market we want
// deep), and it is what makes a bond a hold rather than an arbitrage (§9.6 — `DISCOUNT_BPS` must
// stay strictly under `sellTaxBps`, a relation a separate trade fee does nothing for).
//

// worker's wiring are gone, and `TRADE_FEE` no longer exists, so nothing is one env var from live.

// ═══ EMISSION — RETIRED (economy v3 step 1: kill the faucet) ═══
// The Street Wage lived here: a hard-capped endowment releasing a halving daily budget, paid
// pro-rata to respect gained. v3's first wall is "no faucet" — zero mint reasons that pay a player,
// so in-game $OMR can never exceed what was DEPOSITED and "extraction <= inflow" stops being a
// constraint the reserve queue enforces and becomes an identity the ledger exhibits. A scheduled
// printer is precisely what that wall forbids, so the block and its helpers are gone rather than
// zeroed: a dormant faucet is one env var away from being a live one.
//
// The reason `emission:wage` is NOT gone — `invariants.js` still counts the rows it wrote (a live
// database holds them and conservation is a whole-ledger claim) and asserts that no NEW one appears.
// See src/emission.js for the tombstone and BALANCE.md § THE FARM for the measured Sybil economics
// that made a per-account-capped wage pay a farm of cheap identities better than a real player.

// ═══ THE DESK — where a spent $OMR goes (economy v3 step 2: recycle instead of burn) ═══
// Design: omerta-economy-v3-design.md §3.3, §4.1, §4.2. A sink used to DESTROY the token. Now it
// hands it to the desk, which sells it back to the market at the daily auction. The reasoning, in
// the design's own words: "every OMR sink is the house's cut", so annual revenue ≈ annual sink
// volume × price, and the KPI is RETURN VELOCITY — how many times a year one token comes home —
// rather than supply. You cannot burn AND recycle the same unit: burning supports price, recycling
// produces revenue. The founder chose revenue, which also means the pitch must never call this
// deflationary (design §10 risk B).
//
// `SINK_REASONS` is the SINGLE list of $OMR sink reasons: `invariants.js` builds the §10.4 burn term
// from it, and the ledger hook in game.js decides what feeds the desk from it. Two copies of this
// list is the drift that would quietly destroy supply the desk was supposed to sell, so there is
// one. (Trailing `%` = a LIKE prefix, otherwise an exact reason.)

    // §10.4 $OMR conservation check (a stable −N = the total ever spent on modules; found live via the
    // Discord alert 2026-08-07). Adding it here counts the burn AND (via the shared recyclesToDesk)
    // feeds the shelf like every other sink — and because it now counts the HISTORICAL rows, the live
    // drift resolves to 0 on the next check with no migration. The paired CASH `kitchen:module` row is

// reads), so the anchor is 1/that — inverted once, at the edge, and never again.
//
// THE ELEGANT PART, and the reason the band and the auction are ONE block: the auction's RESERVE is
// the band's upper edge. Above `UPPER` the desk should be selling, below it should not, and a Dutch

// ═══ THE FLOAT (economy v3 step 5) — THE MADE MAN and THE ACCESS STAKE ═══
// Design §5 (the holding problem), §11.2, §11.5.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, stated plainly: a consumable you should never HOLD cannot be the loot
// that makes killing worth it. If the rational play is buy-and-spend-instantly, nobody carries a
// balance, there is nothing on the body, and the extraction path is empty. Forcing a FLOAT is
// therefore the central mechanic, not a detail. Two mechanisms, both reusing shipped systems.
//
// (1) THE MADE MAN — a recurring $OMR subscription that buys STANDING, not power. It is the
//     strongest of the two because it creates CONTINUOUS demand rather than one-off demand.
//
//     WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT, and the reasoning matters (§11.2). The obvious move is to
//     re-denominate operating costs — business upkeep, crew wages, territory upkeep — from cash into
//     $OMR. That is REJECTED: it would mean a player MUST buy real money to keep earning, which is a
//     subscription wall on the core loop rather than a premium tier, and it converts a free game into
//     a rented one. **OPERATING COSTS STAY IN CASH. ALL OF THEM.** That is the line that keeps the
//     game free, and it is the binding constraint (§4.3: $OMR buys TIME, ACCESS and STATUS — never POWER).
//
//     So being made gates the SOCIAL AND PRESTIGE layer plus pure convenience, and gates no earning
//     loop's POWER: a free player runs a complete empire — streets, crime, kitchen, family, PvP, the
//     Law, the Pen, the market, the fronts — at full strength, and can hunt made men for their $OMR.
//     That is RuneScape membership and EVE PLEX, and it is the honest answer to "is this pay-to-win":
//     paying buys you a seat at tables where you can LOSE money. It buys no advantage at any of them.
//
//     ── §4.3 IS RETIRED. $OMR MAY BUY POWER (founder directive, 2026-08-02). ──
//     This paragraph and the two above are kept as the RECORD of what the rule was, because ~15 sites
//     cite it and a reader who finds one needs to know it no longer binds. D8=C had briefly narrowed
//     the gates to status only; the founder then retired the underlying rule outright and answered
//     D8=D, so both retired ACCESS gates are BACK (speakeasy, the high-stakes stake) and the ladder
//     below is the power layer. What replaces §4.3 is not "anything goes" — it is a CEILING:
//
//       (a) POWER IS CAPPED, and the cap is reachable without paying. That is the whole claim the
//           player-facing copy now makes, and it is checkable rather than rhetorical — see MADE_LADDER.
//       (b) NO POWER IN COMBAT. Not on p2w grounds, on LOOP grounds. Offensive power makes paying
//           players predators on free ones, which empties the free population that makes the streets
//           worth walking. Defensive power makes made men harder to rob, which directly undercuts
//           "a free man can hunt you for your $OMR" — the loop the whole float exists to create.
//           Combat is the one axis where power costs you the thing power is supposed to feed.
//       (c) OPERATING COSTS STAY IN CASH. §11.2's line survives untouched: nobody must buy real
//           money to keep earning. A ladder you may climb is a premium tier; a bill you must pay is
//           a rented game.

//     job is to create permanent, VISIBLE, LOOTABLE float attached to exactly the players worth

// ═══ THE LADDER — power for HOLDING (founder decision D8=D, 2026-08-02) ═══
// With §4.3 retired, the question stopped being "may $OMR buy power" and became "attached to WHAT".
// The two answers do OPPOSITE things to the float, which is the problem step 5 exists to solve:
//   • attached to the SUBSCRIPTION (spend 20, get X) → demand to SPEND. Revenue and deflation, no float.
//   • attached to the STAKED BALANCE (hold N, get X) → demand to HOLD. That IS the float, and it is
//     what makes OMR_LOOT_COMMITTED mean anything and killing a made man worth the ammo.
// So the ladder keys on `account_persistent.staked`, and being made climbs it by MADE_RUNGS.
//
// WHY BEING MADE IS A SHORTCUT AND NOT A GATE, which is a deliberate deviation from the shape first
// proposed to the founder and is driven by a MEASUREMENT rather than taste. $OMR has no faucet since
// v3 step 1; a free player's lifetime supply is the mission ladder — 9 jobs, and the last two need
// level 100. Requiring BOTH a recurring dues burn AND a held stake would put the ladder out of a
// free player's reach entirely, which would break the one claim the new player-facing copy makes.
// As a shortcut, dues buy a real rung AND the ceiling stays reachable without paying.
//
// THE CEILING IS THE CLAIM, and it is checkable rather than rhetorical: the top rung's `min` sits
// under what the mission ladder pays lifetime, so a free player who works it clears the whole ladder.
// Paying gets you there sooner and for less held; it does not get you higher. `test/made.js` pins
// that RELATION against the live MISSIONS and MADE_LADDER tables so a retune of either cannot quietly
// make the copy false — which is not hypothetical: both have since been rescaled ~6× together, and
// the relation held while every literal that had been written into a comment went stale.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: anything in COMBAT — see the §4.3 note above for why that is a loop
// argument, not a p2w one. The perks are CAPACITY (carry more, hold more energy/nerve, park more) plus
// ONE economic edge at the top rung on the FENCE — an ACTIVE loop you have to boost cars to use,
// not a passive drip, so the ladder rewards playing rather than idling. Every number is a founder
// sign-off lever; `fenceBps` is the only one that moves a signed faucet and is sim-measured (P9.28).

// never become the retired "staked is safe" harbour (test/made.js pins it by killing a locked
// holder). (2) The multiplier moves the LADDER READ only — a status/capacity axis — never the
// balance itself: `staked` stays the §10.4 bucket and no currency moves at lock time (zero ledger
// rows, test-pinned). (3) While a lock is active it may only be UPGRADED (new expiry ≥ current AND

// The runite-ore answer, built as a MATERIAL and never a currency. Once a day the city gets a
// shipment of something the catalogs cannot produce, landing at a seed-drawn district (forecastable
// like every §7.11 draw — you can plan for it, you cannot manufacture it), first-come against a
// CITY-WIDE daily cap with a per-player cap so one whale cannot take the lot.
//
// Every part of this is chosen against the failure it would otherwise cause:
//  · NOT A CURRENCY — an owned quantity on the character, like trunk cargo or contraband: LOOTABLE
//    on a fire-kill, dies with the street, never touches §10.4.
//  · AN INPUT, NEVER AN OUTPUT — it pays no cash. Its only use is COMMISSIONING a bespoke piece,
//    which is a cash SINK. So the drop is emission-safe BY CONSTRUCTION: nothing about it can
//    inflate anything, and the material's whole economic role is to gate a sink.
//  · CONTENTION IS THE FEATURE — a city-wide cap plus a drawn location is the "swarm contention on a
//    limited respawn" this was designed from, and the first thing here where being THERE and being
//    EARLY beats being rich.
//  · THE APEX CARTELS DROP IT — routing an apex outfit yields units, so the reservoir loop finally
//    pays in the scarce thing rather than the abundant one.
//
// The commissions are BESPOKE PIECES: numbered, account-level, purely cosmetic status objects. That
// is deliberate — a material that bought POWER would make a contested drop pay-to-win for whoever
// can camp a district, and the whole point of a luxury layer is that surplus wealth buys standing,
// never advantage.

// ── THE POPULATION step three — THE TURNOVER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Steps one/two lit the city up ONCE: residents have no income, so the seed pool is a STOCK, not a
// flow (the red-team's correction to the sim's own claim). Once players drain it — duels, fades,
// order-fills, kills — the stake-backed boards go quiet again and the alpha is back where it
// started. So the worker now RETIRES a resident players have picked clean and lets the top-up put a
// fresh face in their place: the city renews itself.
//
// That makes `npc:seed` a RECURRING faucet rather than a one-shot, which is exactly why it gets an
// explicit ceiling — and the ceiling meters RETIREMENTS, not seeding. Every retirement is what
// creates the vacancy a fresh seed pays for, so counting them bounds the faucet exactly; counting
// dollars seeded does not, because the day-one fill of an empty city is ~48 seeds that replace
// nobody and would eat the whole allowance before a single resident had been drained.
//
// So the rule reads plainly: **at most PER_DAY residents are replaced in a day** — a headcount, held
// in the `population_state` singleton (restart-proof, and free of any genesis interaction). At the
// weighted mean seed that bounds the faucet at roughly $500k/day, the same band as a territory
// racket or the boxing purse. Spent, the city simply keeps its drained residents until the day rolls.
POPULATION.TURNOVER = {
  // "picked clean" = holding less than this share of what they ARRIVED with. Compared against
  // `characters.npc_seed`, never a flat cash floor: a flat floor can't tell a drained boss from a
  // corner kid who was BORN with $200, and would respawn the cheap bands forever — an infinite
  // faucet loop. The margin is deliberate: a resident who has parked the maximum in escrow (a loan
  // offer plus a buy order) still holds ~52% of their stake, well clear of this line.

// The crew co-op loops (heists → fillHeist, world raids → hireRaid) already let a solo player hire NPC
// bodies. The SCHEDULED-FIELD co-op games did not: a solo player who entered the poker tournament waited
// out the window and got REFUNDED for lack of a field (< MIN_ENTRANTS). Now residents standing at the
// Neon Mile fill a human-started tournament — a warm body paying its OWN buy-in into the SAME escrow the
// human path uses (recycle-only; §10.4 untouched, the 'poker tourney escrow' identity holds). REACTIVE
// ONLY: a resident enters a tournament a HUMAN already materialized and never spins one up itself, so the
// city never manufactures fake events and /v1/online stays an honest human count. A retired/killed
// resident's entry auto-burns as casino:tourney:death at resolve (the LEFT-JOIN dead path), so no escrow
// cleanup is needed on retirement. Bounded so a solo human always gets a playable field but residents
// don't flood it. Founder sign-off lever.

  // with it `launderAtBusiness`. That is the interlock DISCHARGED, not bypassed: with no way to turn
  // cash into $OMR there is no outside price to pump the fixed rate against, so "arbitrage is
  // impossible by construction" is now true rather than aspirational. The test that enforced it

  // the §7.2 faucet covers only the REMAINDER. The PAYOUT is unchanged (the sim-signed §7.2 band), so

  // notification and no counterplay from a stranger's crime roll. Taking from a PLAYER is what the

  // only the honor ledger: your attack carries REVENGE_ATK_MULT, and a landed robbery takes
  // REVENGE_CUT_MULT of the usual cut (rob 15% → 22.5%, still under the shakedown's signed 30%, on

// tradeable ERC-1155 through the EXISTING GearVault rail. Two rules from the design are load-bearing
// and both are enforced here rather than remembered:
//
//   1. SELL DETERMINISTIC, DROP RANDOM — as SHIPPED. Rarity is rolled server-side and rng_audit'd
//      when an item is EARNED IN PLAY — a boosted car, a bought boat, a resident's ride you steal —
//      and the `rarity:upgrade` sink is a KNOWN outcome for a KNOWN price (pay, get exactly the
//      next tier), never a roll. NOTE (2026-08-21): the game-wide "never distribute by chance" RULE
//      was retired by the founder, so a randomized paid product is now designable — but THIS
//      upgrade stays deterministic as built (changing it is its own product decision, not a
//      cleanup), and the FACT that selling random traits for real money is a loot box genuinely
//      contested in the EU/UK survives the rule's retirement: any future random-for-money product
//      publishes its odds and goes through the launch checklist's counsel rows.
//   2. IN-GAME ITEMS ARE LOOTABLE; EXTRACTED NFTs ARE SAFE BUT INERT. Extraction takes the item OUT
//      OF PLAY: it stops racing, melting, fencing, hauling and being stolen, and in exchange it stops
//      dying with the street. That is the existing gear precedent applied to property, and it is what
//      preserves EVE's destruction engine while still giving a real NFT market — the choice is the
//      product, so neither half may be softened (a safe item that still earns is a strictly-dominant
//      option and the tradeoff disappears).
//
// RARITY HAS BOUNDED HORIZONTAL UTILITY. It improves a car's CHASSIS contribution to race power and
// a boat's BASE hold/speed by at most 10%; it never multiplies driver stats, tuning, naval upgrades,
// resale/book value or melt yield. The item has a real reason to be sought out, while a rarity badge
// cannot turn every other progression investment into paid power. Extracted NFTs remain inert until
// their holder burns/re-imports them, keeping the safe-vs-useful choice intact.

// ═══ THE TRANCHE SCHEDULE (dynasty-machine §10 Shape D — ADOPTED, founder-directed 2026-08-10:
// "first 1000 mints are .01 ETH or x OMR … next 2000 are .02 ETH and 2x OMR"; REVISED the same day
// to FIVE WAVES WITH A HARD CEILING — "cap it at 5 waves so by wave 5 the maximum mint price anyone
// can pay would be .05"). The identity mint's published price table, indexed to CUMULATIVE minted
// identities.
//
// WHY THE CEILING IS THE IMPROVEMENT, not a softening. The open LINEAR ladder it replaces was
// defensible but had two costs the cap removes outright:
//   - THE FREE-PATH LAW BECOMES STRUCTURAL. On the old ladder the dearest row was an open-ended
//     number and the law held by arithmetic that had to be re-checked at every extension. Here the
//     dearest row sits under the lifetime mission payout and no future row can ever exceed it, so
//     "you can get made for free" is now guaranteed by the SHAPE rather than re-derived per table.
//   - THE GROWTH HEADWIND GOES. The waves widen (1k → 100k) while the increments SHRINK
//     (+0.015, +0.010, +0.010, +0.006), so the curve flattens exactly where a game gets crowded.
//     Past the first thousand it is cheaper than the ladder it replaces at every point — #5,000
//     pays 0.025 where the old table charged 0.03, #20,000 pays 0.035 against 0.06.
// The ceiling is what makes it a founding-era discount rather than an escalator: the most anyone
// ever pays for an identity is 0.05 ETH, and that is true on the day the table is published.
//
// The RULES, each load-bearing:
//   - ONE implied rate per row, every row (omr/eth == 3,000 — the preflight two-rails guard's own
//     number): the effective price is the CHEAPER rail, so a row that broke rank would silently
//     become the real price. Pinned by test.
//   - THE FLAT TAIL: past the last row the LAST price HOLDS until the founder publishes an
//     extension — the schedule is a finite commitment, never an open-ended escalator.
//   - THE FREE-PATH LAW: no row's omr may reach the mission ladder's lifetime $OMR payout (the
//     "get made for free" promise, test-pinned in test/made.js against the LIVE MISSIONS table —
//     dearest row 150 vs ~220 earnable, and with the ceiling it can never rise again).
//   - EXECUTION is the existing machinery, BY HAND at each boundary: one Safe `setFees` tx +
//     MINT_FEE_ETH/PLEX_MINT_OMR env — plexQuote already scales the $OMR rail off MINT_FEE_ETH, so
//     no code runs a boundary. The admin chain panel shows tier progress + flags a live pair that
//     is OFF this schedule; preflight warns on an off-schedule pair at boot.
// Adoption re-opened a launch-checklist row (a published forward schedule on a tradeable asset).
// Copy rules ride with it: founding-era frame only, never a countdown/"N remaining" counter, the
// banned lexicon verbatim.
// The founder's waves are 1k / 10k / 25k / 50k / 100k at .01 / .025 / .0333 / .0444 / .05 ETH.
// Waves 3 and 4 are rounded to .035 / .045 (+5.1% / +1.4%) so both waves land on tidy numbers.
//
// THE SCHEDULE IS ETH, AND ONLY ETH (founder-directed 2026-08-10: "Make the mint ETH only no OMR").
// There is no $OMR column because there is no $OMR rail: minting gates extraction, so it is the one
// price that must never be ambiguous, and a fee with two rails is always priced by the cheaper one.

// THE WEIGHT IS LINEAR AND UNCAPPED, and that is the correction to a measured bug rather than a
// preference. `BALANCE.md` § THE FARM, on the Street Wage: "`WAGE_CAP_OMR` is commented
// 'anti-concentration / anti-Sybil', but concentration is the OPPOSITE of Sybil. It clips the
// honest whale and hands the remainder to whoever runs more accounts — the only way around a
// per-individual cap is to be several individuals." Stated as the general law:
//     concave score (a per-account cap, or log-share)  →  splitting effort across N accounts GAINS
//     linear score                                     →  splitting gains nothing   ← what we want
//     convex score                                     →  splitting loses, but whales concentrate
// So: linear, uncapped. "Plays more, receives more" is the founder's intent, not a leak.
//
// A GATE IS NOT A CAP, and the difference is the whole trick. MIN_TRACKS is an ELIGIBILITY gate, so
// it imposes a FIXED COST PER ACCOUNT without ever clipping an honest player's payout. A farm with N
// accounts pays that cost N times while its reward stays linear — Sybil-NEGATIVE. A per-account cap
// does the exact opposite. Both "limit" something; they point in opposite directions.
//
// TAGS IS FAIL-CLOSED, AND IT IS THE SEVERANCE WALL. Tokenomics v2 severed cash from $OMR ("cash
// cannot become $OMR at any price"). Raw mastery XP would reopen it: verified in `src/casino.js`,
// the Madame's T1 perk COMPS THE NERVE on both dice (:116) and blackjack (:844), and `sellGood`
// carries no nerve/energy/cooldown check at all — so for anyone with Madame standing, den and
// commerce XP are bounded only by cash and HTTP round trips. Cash would buy a larger share of the
// bought-$OMR pool. (The pool is fixed, so nothing is CREATED and the landing page's claim stays
// true — but the wall's own language is "at any price", and it should stay crisp.)
//   THE RULE: an action scores only if the GAME throttles it — nerve, energy, a cooldown, or a hard
//   per-day cap. Nobody can buy wall-clock. A tag absent from this list scores ZERO, so a new action
//   added later contributes nothing until somebody deliberately adds it (the DESK.SINK_REASONS
