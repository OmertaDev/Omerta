// ═══ THE SHIPMENT (omerta-scarcity-design.md §3) — the contested material ═══
// Every item in this city is infinite-supply at a deterministic price, and the one genuinely
// contested rate-limited resource (the cartel reservoirs) pays CASH — the abundant thing. This is
// the other kind: a daily quantity the catalogs cannot produce, landing where the seed says, taken
// first-come against a city-wide cap.
//
// §10.4 SURFACE: the MATERIAL is not a currency — it is an owned quantity on the character (the
// contraband / heist-loot precedent), so taking it writes NO ledger row and it never enters the
// conservation set. The one value that moves is the COMMISSION's cash, a character_id'd SINK
// (`shipment:commission`) that check (a) reconciles. There is no faucet here at all: the material
// pays nothing and exists only to gate a sink.
