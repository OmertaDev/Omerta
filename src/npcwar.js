// THE BLOOD WAR — NPC families as a PvE antagonist (omerta-npc-families-defend-design.md).
//
// NPC families (step one: joinable shells) become attackable OUTFITS on the WORLD-raid pattern, NOT the
// player-gang war system. That choice is the whole design: `declareWar` feeds season_wars → Commission
// standing, so an NPC family that never retaliates would be a fixed-price purchase of standing. Here a
// raid loots a bounded `war_pool` reservoir and banks a SEPARATE account-level `family_war` legend that
// NEVER touches Commission standing — the flagged faucet is severed by construction.
//
// §10.4: `family:raid` is a bounded cash FAUCET (attacker character_id'd, capped by RAID_BPS × the
// regen-bounded pool — the world:raid twin) + an ammo SINK. `war_pool` is a strength reservoir, NOT a
// §10.4 bucket (the world strength precedent), so the only invariant surface is the vocabulary.
//
// THE DEFENCE (both paths built): a landed raid fires EXACTLY ONE retaliation — either the guns catch you
// AT THE SCENE now (COUNTER_P, an immediate hospitalization) OR you escape and the family REMEMBERS,
// sending someone after you later (THE MANHUNT — sweepFamilyAggro, a worker-resolved, shield-honouring
// strike; one pending per family). Chained so you're never double-punished. A raid is a real risk decision.
