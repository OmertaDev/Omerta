// ── THE COMMUNITY DROP — G-3's claim rail (D1 variant b: in-game credit via SIWE) ──
//
// The launch sequence's airdrop (omerta-launch-sequence-design.md G-3), built as the RECOMMENDED
// variant: the claim page links a wallet (the SIWE rail, live today), verifies it against the
// published allocation dataset, and credits IN-GAME $OMR — which converts the drop from a token
// scatter into USER ACQUISITION (every claimant is a registered account standing inside the game,
// and the claimed value is extractable only through the audited rail: mint gate → toll → surcharge).
// "Unclaimed" never left the Safe at all, which is also why THE CLAWBACK needs no function here —
// it is the window closing (`drop_state.closes_at` passing), the design's own argument for (b).
//
// THE WHITELIST rides the same row: a snapshotted wallet's claim also grants ONE free identity mint
// (`mint_credits += 1`), consumed on use, never repeated — and the grant marks the account
// (`drop_free_mint`, direct SQL, off persistAccount's positional list) so the TRANCHE COUNTER can
// exclude it: the published schedule indexes PAID mints only (G-3 rule 2 — a whitelist wave must
// not push paid minters up tiers). An already-minted claimant gets the $OMR and no dead credit
// (the payPackagePlex MED-1 lesson: never grant an unspendable entitlement).
//
// §10.4: `drop:claim` is an enumerated $OMR MINT (in `omrMints` + the `drop:` vocabulary), backed
// by the Safe's genesis reserve exactly like `mission:%` — hard $OMR that never entered the in-game
// buckets until the claim. The `drop claims ledgered` check (invariants.js) reconciles the minted
// total against the claimed allocation rows, so a credit with no allocation behind it trips the
// §10.4 sweep. The free-mint waiver moves no value (an entitlement — the fees.js precedent).
//
// Anti-Sybil: the SNAPSHOT is the bound (a historical block cannot be farmed), so there is no
// agent/level gate here — eligibility is the wallet, once, ever. Amounts stay SEALED until the
// window opens (the board reveals your row only while claims are open, or after you claimed).

// ed25519 key, verified dependency-free (src/sol.js), then the SAME latch + settle as the EVM leg.
//
// Consequences, each deliberate:
//  - One account may claim SEVERAL Solana envelopes (a holder with three wallets claims all three
//    into their one account). That multiplies nothing — each envelope is its own allocation row
//    with its own once-ever latch, and extra free-mint credits are dead past the account's one
//    `minted` (the payPackagePlex rule already guards the grant).
//  - Base58 is CASE-SENSITIVE: the latch matches the address VERBATIM (never lower() — the EVM
//    convention explicitly does not apply), and the loader stores it verbatim.
//  - The challenge binds the ACCOUNT (accountId + nonce in the message), so a signature cannot be
