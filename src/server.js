  // Hand-rolled rather than a plugin, on the sol.js/avatar.js precedent: the whole of it is a short

  // on the one response path every route in the game passes through.

  // NARROW ON PURPOSE, and each exclusion is a property rather than a preference:
  //   • gzip only. Brotli is better and needs an encoding negotiation this does not have; gzip is
  //     understood by every client that has existed since 1999 and gets ~70% of the bytes.
  //   • enumerated content types only. Images, video and fonts are ALREADY compressed — gzipping a
  //     JPEG spends CPU to make it very slightly bigger.
  //   • above a threshold. Under ~1 KB the framing overhead can grow the payload, and the CPU is
  //     never worth a round trip that was one packet anyway.
  //   • never on 204/304/206 or a HEAD. A range response is the sharp one: /art/:file serves video
  //     with `accept-ranges: bytes`, and compressing a byte range makes the range a lie.
  //   • never over an existing content-encoding, and never once the head is on the wire (the
  //     fail-safe the header hook above already documents — an onSend must not crash the server).

  // GET /health — the question "is it up?" answered directly, keyless, for a human or an uptime monitor.

  // alert on status alone. DEPLOY.md covers the one judgement call: point an UPTIME MONITOR at this, and
  // think twice before making it the platform's own health check — restarting the API does not fix a
  // database, it just adds a restart loop to an outage.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS KEYLESS AND IT TOUCHES THE DATABASE TWICE, which is the exact pair the BLUE-TEAM H4
  // default-throttle closed for every keyless `/v1` GET — and this route sits outside `/v1`, so it
  // took zero buckets (measured: a keyless `/v1/city` is cut off after 30 hits a window, `/health`
  // accepted 400 and would have accepted any number, each costing two round trips). Unauthenticated
  // DB amplification on the one endpoint an attacker does not have to guess.
  //
  // A 429 is the WRONG fix here, and that is the whole reason this is a cache instead: a monitor
  // that reads 429 as "down" raises a false alarm, and one that reads it as "not down" learns to
  // ignore a real 503. So the answer keeps flowing and the AMPLIFICATION goes: a short TTL plus

  // monitor's once-a-minute hit always does the real thing. Liveness is preserved; the leverage is not.
