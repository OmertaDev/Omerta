    // game) emits 'error' on ITSELF when its connection dies mid-transaction — and an EventEmitter with
    // no listener THROWS, so the process dies exactly as it did before the idle handler existed.
    //
    // Found by `tools/chaos.js`: terminating backends mid-transaction under load killed the API with
    // `Unhandled 'error' event: Connection terminated unexpectedly`. Same symptom as the 2026-07-25
    // outage, different code path — the earlier fix closed half the door.
    //
    // This is not exotic. It fires on any Postgres restart or failover that lands while a transaction
    // is open, on a network blip, on an admin `pg_terminate_backend` — and, pointedly, on our OWN
    // `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` (30s, set below), which exists to stop a leaked transaction
    // holding row locks forever. That safety valve terminates the backend, so before this handler it
    // could take the whole server down with it.
    //
    // Logging is the entire correct response. node-pg already rejects the in-flight query's promise, so
    // the request still fails through the normal path and answers 503 db_down; the client is discarded
    // rather than returned to the pool. All this prevents is the unhandled throw. Attached ONCE per
    // client (a pooled client is checked out many times — re-attaching would leak listeners until
    // Node's MaxListeners warning fires).
    //
    // WHY THIS WRAPS `connect` AND NOT `query` — verified against pg-pool, not assumed, because the
    // obvious "simplification" is wrong in a way that only shows up during an outage. `pool.query()`
    // attaches its OWN `client.once('error', …)` for the life of the call, so a one-off query is
    // already covered and needs nothing from us. The exposed path is the one this game runs on: every
    // transaction does `pool.connect()` and holds the client across many awaits, and checkout REMOVES
    // the idle-time error listener the pool installed. Between checkout and release there is no
    // listener at all — which is precisely the window a transaction lives in. Removing this wrapper on
    // the grounds that "pg handles client errors" reopens exactly that window; `tools/chaos.js`
    // scenario 2 kills backends mid-transaction and the process dies without it.
