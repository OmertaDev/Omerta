// ── THE CAST & THE STORY — the interpersonal cohesion layer ──────────────────────────────────────
// The game already REMEMBERS every relationship a street has — rival_events (who moved on you),
// kill_log (the blood between two bloodlines), dynasty_marriages/consiglieri (the alliances),
// contacts (whose number you hold and what you've done for them), vendettas, the bodyguard pair,
// the family roster — but it remembered them into eight separate boards, so a rivalry never read
// as a RELATIONSHIP, only as rows. This module is the one place all of it is read TOGETHER:
//
//   GET /v1/people                       — THE CAST: your nemesis, your spouse, your adviser,
//                                          your family, who you guard and who guards you, the
//                                          contacts you've worked for, the open vendettas
//   GET /v1/people/history/:characterId — THE STORY OF YOU AND THEM: one merged, chronological
//                                          timeline of everything recorded between your bloodline
//                                          and theirs
//
// PURE READS — zero §10.4 surface (nothing moves, nothing is written), no locks beyond the
// caller's own readCharacter. Two rules are load-bearing:
//   * ACCOUNT UUIDs never leave (the rivals/contacts posture) — every party resolves to its
//     bloodline's CURRENT living street, or to a name snapshot when the line is dead.
//   * THE INFO-ECONOMY RULE: the story only surfaces what the game already TOLD both parties.
//     rival_events is recorded only from acts whose notify names the aggressor; kill_log names the
//     killer at the estate; a marriage/divorce/peace offer is mutual by construction; a `met`
//     contact line is a mutual meeting. The `detail` JSONB is deliberately NOT surfaced (it can
//     carry amounts), and nothing here pierces anonymity — the $OMR peek/trace stay the piercers.
