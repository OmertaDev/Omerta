// THE COLLISION (real-human-collision-being-rare, founder-directed) — make the RARE moment a real human
// is around VISIBLE and ACTIONABLE, on Home, the second it exists.
//
// OMERTÀ is a deep multiplayer built for a population it has not met yet: the NPC residents (the
// population layer) fill every board, so a player sees SCENERY everywhere and rarely knows when an actual
// human is around. THE ROLODEX (discovery.js) answers "who is near my LEVEL" — but it is a screen you
// visit, level-based, not REACHABLE-now. This answers the sharper question the thin population makes rare:
// "who is a real human near me — in my district (reachable) or near my level (findable) — and are they on
// the wire RIGHT NOW". Surfaced prominently on Home so the collision is seen, not missed.
//
// Three lists: HERE (real humans in YOUR district — the reachable collision: jump/rob/contract/crew),
// NEARBY (real humans near your level elsewhere — travel to them / DM), and HOT DISTRICTS (where the
// humans are, so a lonely player can go TO the action — the convergence nudge). Each row carries an
// `online` flag (the live ●); lists are sorted ONLINE-FIRST so a player on the wire leads.
//
// §10.4-FREE: pure reads, no ledger vocabulary, no write. NO account UUID leaves (the rivals/cast
// discipline — the client keys off the living characterId). RESIDENTS + AGENTS excluded
// (`NOT c.is_npc AND NOT a.agent_flag`) — this surface is specifically about REAL humans, the thing the
// scenery hides. Empty when you're genuinely alone (the empty-state honesty rule; the client hides it).
//
// `online` is surfaced as a FLAG, not a hard filter: a real human in your district who isn't socketed
// this second is still a real collision target (they'll be back; you can contract/DM them), and the ●
// lights when they're live — more robust than a filter that flickers with socket state.
//
// STILL AROUND is the one hard filter, and it exists because the paragraph above is true of a player
// and false of an abandoned account. "They'll be back" is the whole argument for listing someone who
// is offline; somebody who made a character a month ago and never returned will not be back, cannot
// meaningfully be contracted, and crowds out the one board built to cut through noise. The residents
// filter knows about ONE kind of scenery; this is the second kind. See DISCOVERY.SEEN_DAYS for why the
// discriminator is recency rather than level or activity — the wrong choice there hides the whole
// launch-night cohort, who are by definition brand new and have done nothing yet.
