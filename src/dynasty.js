// ═══ DYNASTIC MARRIAGES & THE CONSIGLIERE (CK3 — omerta-marriage-soldiers-design.md, Drop A) ═══
// Account×account ties on the Bloodline (the vendetta/feud-peace pair pattern): a marriage SURVIVES
// death (the heirs stay in-laws), is monogamous, and grants STATUS + the scandal deterrent — never
// immunity (a kill between in-laws still lands; the killer eats MARRIAGE.SCANDAL honor and the
// marriage dissolves — checkScandal is called from runEstate wherever a killerCh exists). The
// wedding buries the feud (vendettas both ways clear — the acceptPeace machinery). §10.4: the
// ceremony/consigliere fees are enumerated character_id'd `dynasty:` cash SINKS (check (a)
// reconciles); everything else is status. Lock posture: every action runs single-party under
// withCharacter (the actor's char lock); marriage rows are keyed on the SORTED account pair and
// mutated by plain row-locked UPDATE/INSERT — the account rows themselves are never a second lock,
// so no AB-BA surface (the feud_peace_offers precedent).
