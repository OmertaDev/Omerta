// ── THE MONEY ROUTER — one declared waterfall over every real-value inflow ────────────────────────
// (founder-directed 2026-08-09: "#2 begin" — consolidate the money router before mainnet.)
//
// The split landscape grew a slice at a time: the sell tax splits three ways, bonds four, the Store
// three, gameplay fees three, the exit toll two, the desk auction two — each individually
// invariant-checked, but nothing stated the WHOLE map in one place, nothing verified the map is
// COMPLETE (an unknown `source` row in vig_revenue/rwa_revenue loosened every unfiltered SUM those
// ledgers feed), and two mirrors ('fee' and 'store') were inserted but never reconciled anywhere.
//
// THIS MODULE MOVES NO MONEY. Three jobs:
//   1. DECLARE  — waterfall(): every real-value inflow and its split, DERIVED from the live signed
//                 constants (STORE.SPLIT_BPS, BONDS.*, SELL_TAX.*, VIG_BPS, TAX.*,
//                 DESK_AUCTION.*) so the declaration structurally cannot drift from the code that
//                 books the slices. Unifying the PERCENTAGES across sources is a separate balance
//                 decision (BALANCE.md § THE MONEY ROUTER) — deliberately NOT made here: folding
//                 rates silently moves real money between destinations (the stock-layer-retirement
//                 lesson, recorded 2026-07-31).
//   2. VERIFY   — runRouterInvariants(): the CROSS-SOURCE layer the five per-system runners
//                 (vig/bond/treasury/desk/exchange) structurally cannot see — source membership on
//                 both revenue ledgers, the two orphan mirrors reconciled, the retired trade rail
//                 staying retired, and the dev_fund balance identity (the one revenue bucket that
//                 had no balance==ledger check).
//   3. DISPLAY  — routerBoard(): WHERE A DOLLAR GOES — the whole waterfall with lifetime figures
//                 per source × destination, one screen (GET /v1/mod/router + the /admin panel).
//
// Import discipline: rules.js (the universal leaf) + vig.js (which imports game/rules — router sits
// at the worker/server layer, so no cycle). Nothing imports router.js except server/worker/tests.
