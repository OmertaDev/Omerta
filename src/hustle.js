// THE HUSTLE — the daily three-stop job chain (founder-directed 2026-07-30: the crime loop must
// route the player AROUND the town — travel, talk to somebody, do the work, collect). The chain is
// seed-drawn per street per day (rules.js `hustleOf` — deterministic + verifiable), every stop is
// SERVER-VERIFIED (you must be standing in the named district to CHECK IN; the legwork stop
// additionally requires a REAL action done since you met the contact, proven by a daily-counter
// DELTA against a baseline snapshot — the counter is global, so where the work happened is not
// knowable and the copy does not claim it is; the routing comes from the three check-ins),
// and the payoff is a bounded once-a-day cash faucet (`hustle:payoff` — the clue-casket posture:
// petty by design, the movement is the product). §10.4: `hustle:` joins the cash vocabulary; the
// payoff is character_id'd so the per-character cash check reconciles. Dies with the street.
