// STILL ON THE TABLE — the cross-system pull the coach's queue can't carry.
//
// The coach (game.js coachLadder) names the SINGLE next step, priority-ordered, five deep — so for a
// mid/late player five more urgent rungs fill the queue and a featured system they've never touched (the
// Den, the Wire, the Stable) never surfaces. And the coach's one-time cross-system rungs stop at level
// 30. This board is the complement: it shows a FEATURED catalog of level-unlocked systems the player has
// never engaged with — a browsable "rackets you haven't worked yet" grid plus an explorer progress line.
// It deliberately does not claim to enumerate the entire city.
//
// PURE READ — no ledger row, no faucet, no new lever, ZERO §10.4 surface. It reads the same owned/acct
// state view() already holds, so it costs no extra query on the hot path (the route hands it loadOwned).
// The engagement signal for each system is either OWNERSHIP (owned.businesses/fighters/speakeasy/…), a
// mastery TRACK (any single action stamps it), or an account-level LEGEND that survives death — so a
// veteran heir is never told to "try" a system their bloodline mastered (the coach's self-clear rule).
import { levelOf, isMade } from './rules.js';

// The catalog lives HERE, not in a rules const: these are display copy + the honest player-facing gate
// (mirrored from coachLadder, the surface a player actually meets), not a signed economy lever — the
// coach's own rung copy lives in game.js and is not lever-pinned either. `at` is the unlock level; `hook`
// is the one-line pitch; `tab` is where the button jumps; `seen(ctx)` is true once the player has
// engaged. Ordered loosely by unlock so the EARLIEST ignored system leads (the most overdue).
