// ── THE COMMUNITY EARMARK + THE FAMILY BUYBACK — Phase 1 of the treasury→family split ────────────
// (founder-directed 2026-08-11: "Lock this in" → "Let's start"; omerta-treasury-to-family-design.md
// §4/§8. This is build-order step 1: the machinery, chain-dormant, every slice lever defaulting to
// ZERO so production is byte-identical until the Phase-2 flip.)
//
// THE FLOW: the revenue ingests (fees.js / store.js / treasury.js recordSellTax + recordHarvestFee)
// carve a community slice out of each REAL payment into `community_revenue` (recordCommunityRevenue,
// below — the rwa_revenue shape: no `real` column, the txHash gate lives at the callers). The keeper
// (runFamilyBuyback — the runVigBuyback twin) spends the UNSPENT community revenue on hard $OMR off
// the canonical pool (mainnet: the DEX bot reports the trade; until then a mod/QA param) and credits
// the bought amount to `family_yield_pool`, which `payFamilyYield` already distributes 5-4-3-2-1 by
// seasonal standing. So the family prize grows on REAL revenue, in in-game $OMR — never real ETH to
// a gang, which is the hard line the whole design exists to hold.
//
// ── THE §10.4 SHAPE, and the decision behind it ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The pool credit is a MINT: `yield:buyback`, an EXACT new reason in invariants.js's omrMints term
// (never the `yield:%` prefix — yield:window and yield:family are genuine transfers and must stay
// out of both terms). It cannot be a transfer, because the credit has no counted-bucket debit — an
// unclassified reason crediting a counted bucket is precisely the kitchen:module silent-drift class.
// It is admissible exactly to the extent the hard token really arrived (the desk:buyback argument),
// which conservation cannot see — so runFamilyBuybackInvariants asserts the soft credit equals the
// hard purchase, real rows only.
//
// DELIBERATELY NO fundReserve — the desk-shelf posture, NOT the bank's, and the reason is where the
// pool's contents can GO: the bank's city pool pays PLAYERS, whose $OMR is extractable, so its hard
// tokens must reach the claim contract and its lifetime paid is named in the Vig's reserve sandwich.
// This pool pays GANG RESERVES, which today are burn-only (seals, the Foundation) — nothing routes a
// gang's $OMR back to an account, so reserve-funding it would raise signable withdrawal capacity for
// claims that cannot be made. The bought hard $OMR stays in the community-buyback wallet (§5 of the
// design doc: the SAME custody the sell-tax community recipient pays into), attested by the
// invariants' `walletMustHold` — the treasury safeMustHold shape. IF a future mechanism ever lets
// gang-reserve $OMR reach an account, this decision re-opens: the credit would then need the bank's
// fundReserve pairing AND a named term in BOTH halves of the Vig sandwich (the cityPaid lesson —
// an unnamed funder does not fail open, it fires spuriously on both halves at once).
//
// COMPS BOOK ZERO — the bank posture, stricter than the desk's: a comp/QA call records the episode
// (auditable) but books zero spend and zero $OMR, because the PRICE is caller-supplied and the
// pool's exit reaches real families — a fabricated price must never mint a colossal credit from a
// small real budget. QA exercises the credit path the way test/bank.js does: a direct call carrying
// a txHash (the mod route strips it unless ALLOW_MOD_REAL_REVENUE=on — the D-MED2 discipline).
//
// Import graph: rules.js (leaf) + game.js (GameError) + exchange.js (fundFamilyYield — ONE
// implementation of the pool credit, the sackEmpire rake-cursor lesson; exchange.js imports only
// rules/game/vanity/commission, none of which import the ingests, so no cycle).
