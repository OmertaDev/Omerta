// THE ROLODEX (omerta-discovery-design.md) — player DISCOVERY, the front door the social layer lacked.
//
// Every social system now EXISTS — crew, family, contacts, rivals, marriage, bodyguard, the read-only
// Cast/Story/Situation cohesion layer — but they all assume you already KNOW who to talk to: a crew
// invite is by exact name, the Wet Work roster is the top 100 by respect (whales, not your peers), and
// the contact book is EARNED through interacting. So a new or mid player who wants to team up has no
// way to FIND peers. This is that surface, and it is the piece that makes THE CREW reachable by
// strangers (the whole point in a low-population game).
//
// Deliberately §10.4-FREE: nothing here moves value or writes a `transactions` row. It is READS + one
// LFG boolean toggle. The `discovery:` word appears in no ledger vocabulary; the lifecycle test proves
// it by counting rows.
//
// HUMANS ONLY on every list — a crew cannot include an NPC resident and an agent is excluded from the
// social front door (`NOT c.is_npc AND NOT a.agent_flag`); residents are already findable on the
// streets roster. If you are genuinely alone the lists are empty, which is the TRUE state and the
// empty-state honesty rule (never dress an empty board as full).
