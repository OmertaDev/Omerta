// ═══ THE STOCK DELIVERY RAIL — treasury-bought stock lands in the STREET DEED (brokers §3.4) ═══
//
// The treasury BUYS tokenized stock (`treasury.js:runStockBuyback`) and OWES units to accounts
// (`stock_allocations`, the play-weighted distribution). This file is the last leg: it delivers those
// owed units into the player's on-chain STREET DEED's ERC-6551 token-bound account, via
// `StockVault.deliver`. Founder-directed 2026-08-14: the container is the DEED, not the Dynasty NFT —
// the deed is the family's real-estate front, "own the street, the street holds your book, sell the
// street and the book goes with it", and keeping stock OFF the identity NFT leaves its
// `balanceOf`-gates-nothing entitlement wall intact (`omerta-identity-nft-design.md` §1).
//
// THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS: a Street Deed is an on-chain ERC-721 only once EXTRACTED
// (`street_deeds.onchain_token_id` non-null). So to RECEIVE delivered stock on-chain a player must own
// AND extract a deed; an account with no extracted deed accrues its allocation as owed and WAITS —
// permanently. There is no expiry, forfeiture, redistribution, or inactivity clawback; delivery just
// has no target yet. This gives the deed real utility (extract it and it becomes your investment vault)
// and changes none of the wall math.
//
// §10.4-NEUTRAL by construction: stock is out-of-band real value (the fees.js/treasury.js precedent).
// This file writes ZERO `transactions` rows — the `allocated <= held` (per ticker, units) wall in
// treasury.js bounds what may be owed, and `delivered <= allocated` (added to runTreasuryInvariants)
// bounds what may be delivered. NOTHING here mints; a delivery is a pre-held `StockVault.deliver`.
//
// CHAIN-DORMANT: the on-chain resolver + the real send need CHAIN_RPC_URL + STREET_DEED_ADDRESS +
// STOCK_VAULT_ADDRESS + the ERC-6551 config; without them `deedTbaFor` returns null and the mod route
// refuses. The DB half (the plan, the deed-required gate, the idempotent ingest, the invariant) is
// fully exercised off-chain.
//
// The two former deferrals are CLOSED (2026-08-14):
//   • Secondary-ownership exclusion — the StreetDeed Transfer watcher maintains `onchain_owner`, and
//     a deed the extractor SOLD stops being their delivery target (deedTbaFor / the plan / the board
//     all apply the same case-insensitive exclusion vs the SIWE wallet; NULL fails OPEN).
//   • The real keeper TX — `runStockDeliveryKeeper` below stages + CLAIMS + sends
//     `StockVault.deliver` (dormant unless CHAIN_RPC_URL + STOCK_VAULT_ADDRESS + STOCK_KEEPER_PK);
//     the Delivered watcher is still the only thing that confirms/flips.
//   • The vault SURVIVING A BURN — tokenId is keccak(NAME), so a re-imported street sold IN-GAME
//     hands its vault to the buyer, and a database row is not an ERC-721 transfer (nothing on that
//     path could warn anybody). Answered by DISCLOSURE rather than a mechanism change, because the
//     name↔id bijection is what makes a burned deed's vault recoverable at all: `vaultHistoryFor`
//     below (the record, on the card and every listing) + `vaultLiveBalances` (the buy-confirm read).
// STILL open, flagged rather than hidden (brokers §3.4, launch-review):
//   • Drain-before-sale: a deed's owner controls its TBA, so a seller can empty it before selling —
//     inherent to gateless push into any tradeable NFT's TBA; the StreetDeed listing lock forces the
//     drain BEFORE the unlock, which is the most any on-chain rule can do, and the buy-confirm live
//     read is what lets an in-game buyer see the result of it before they pay.

// the street with no sight of it. That bijection is load-bearing rather than a bug (it is what makes a
// burned deed's vault RECOVERABLE instead of stranded at an address nobody can ever reach again), so
// the answer is DISCLOSURE: the deed card and every market listing state what the vault has received,
// and a buyer prices it. The terms ride with the price — the pad, the nut, the Port lane.
//
// "RECEIVED", NEVER "HOLDS". This reads `stock_deliveries` — the record of what was PUSHED IN — and
// the account's owner controls that account and can move tokens out of it at any time. A delivered
// total presented as a balance would be a false claim on a purchase screen, which is strictly worse
// than saying nothing; the live figure needs an RPC read and rides the buy-CONFIRM step

// cannot both send; and even a lost race is bounded by the contract's usedDeliveryId, which makes the
// second send a clean revert), and hands the send to `_sendDeliver`. It NEVER confirms — the
// Delivered watcher is the only thing that flips an allocation, so a tx that never lands leaves a
// claimed-pending row the resend window retries (sent_at older than RESEND_MS ⇒ eligible again).
// Ticker → ERC-20 address comes from the Postgres mirror of the Safe-owned StockTokenRegistry. A
// planned ticker with no ACTIVE approved address is SKIPPED BY NAME, never silently (the community-
// keeper no_budget lesson — a stranded delivery must not read like an empty plan). `opts.tokens`
