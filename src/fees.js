// §11 inbound fee ingestion — the entry (0.01 ETH mint) and revive-insurance (0.10 ETH
// respawn) fees. Players pay them ON-CHAIN to the OmertaFees contract, which forwards the
// ETH straight to the developer wallet in the same transaction — this backend never custodies
// ETH and never mints in-game value from a fee. The worker's fee watcher observes the
// contract's MintFeePaid / RespawnFeePaid events and calls `recordFeePayment` here, which
// (idempotently) records the payment and credits the paying account an in-game entitlement:
//   • mint    → account.mint_credits +1   (spend via POST /v1/character/mint → account.minted)
//   • respawn → account.respawn_tokens +1 (auto-consumed on a killing blow, see social.js)
//   • reroll  → account.reroll_credits +1 (spend via POST /v1/character/reroll → re-roll the build)
//
// Isolation: this module writes only `fee_payments`, the four entitlement columns on
// `account_persistent` (minted / mint_credits / respawn_tokens / reroll_credits), and — on a
// reroll spend — the paying character's OWN stat columns (a total-conserved re-roll, no value
// moves). It writes ZERO rows to `transactions` — real ETH is out-of-band value, outside the
// §10.4 in-game conservation set (a re-roll only redistributes a fixed stat budget, no currency).
