// THE RARITY NFTs — economy v3 step 7 (design §7, §9.7).
//
// Cars and boats carry a rarity rolled when they are EARNED, and an owned one can be EXTRACTED
// on-chain through the EXISTING GearVault rail. This module is the in-game half: the board a player
// reads, and the one deterministic $OMR sink that upgrades a rarity. The signing half lives in
// chain.js next to `requestGearWithdraw`, because that is where the reserve, the nonce and the
// EIP-712 signer already are.
//
// **NO CONTRACT CHANGE.** GearVault's `mint(to, gearId, amount)` takes a bare uint256 with a
// per-id lifetime cap, so "extend GearVault's pattern to cars/boats" is a TOKEN-ID SPACE decision
// off-chain, not a new contract: gear keeps 1..N, cars sit at 100000+, boats at 200000+
// (`RARITY.TOKEN`). That matters beyond convenience — the design says steps 6 and 7 "touch contracts
// and therefore reset the third-party audit clock", and step 7 turns out not to. Each new tokenId
// still needs its Safe-set `cap` at deploy (fail-closed at 0, so an un-capped class simply cannot
// mint), which is deploy config rather than code.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: nothing sells a rarity for ETH, and nothing rolls one for money.
// `upgradeRarity` is a KNOWN outcome at a KNOWN price. See the RARITY block in rules.tail.js for
// why that line is load-bearing rather than fastidious.
