// TOKENOMICS v2 — THE EXCHANGE and THE FAMILY YIELD (founder-directed 2026-07-27).
// Design: omerta-tokenomics-v2-design.md
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// v2 severs cash → OMR. That single change is the point of the whole rework: today every cash faucet
// in the game is secretly a token-price decision, because in-game cash converts to OMR. The measured
// maxed passive stack is $21.6M/day for ONE player, and the only things between that and sell
// pressure are a wash cap and AMM depth. Cut the conversion and cash becomes a purely internal
// gameplay resource — you could 10x every faucet and the token would not notice.
//
// But you CANNOT implement that by disabling one side of the AMM. `swap` is constant-product over a
// cash reserve and an OMR reserve; make it one-directional and every trade removes cash and adds
// OMR, nothing refills the cash side, and the reserves skew monotonically until the price approaches
// zero and the window shuts itself. A one-way AMM is not a market — it is a draining bucket. So the
// AMM is replaced by a purpose-built redemption window:
//
//     burn X OMR  →  X × EXCHANGE.RATE cash, from a pool that only real cash SINKS feed,
//                    clamped to what was funded, clamped to a per-account daily cap.
//
// The Phase-4 stake-pool discipline, applied to cash: the window is a CLAIM ON WHAT WAS FUNDED,
// never a promise. A dry pool refuses cleanly and burns nothing.
//
// Arbitrage is impossible BY CONSTRUCTION — cash has no exit in v2, so there is no outside price to
// arbitrage the window against. That is the quiet benefit of the one-way design and it is why a flat
// published rate is safe here where it would not be in a two-way market.
//
// §10.4: `window:burn` is an $OMR SINK — it sits in the burn TERM (so conservation stays exact)
// but the value is not destroyed: it is in DESK.SINK_REASONS, so a paired `desk:recycle` row hands
// it to the shelf. `window:payout` is a character_id'd cash
// FAUCET — honest about being one, bounded by the pool, and reconciled by a new `exchange pool
// backed` invariant (paid <= funded) which proves it is a redistribution of real sinks rather than
// inflation. The prefix is `window:` and NOT `exchange:` on purpose — the M3 cb/ammo barter board
// already owns `exchange:`, and two systems sharing a reason prefix is exactly how a vocabulary
// check stops meaning anything.
