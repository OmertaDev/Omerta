// STREET DEEDS — the map as property (omerta-street-deeds-design.md). A named, mapped plot of the
// world a player OWNS and builds a legend on — the Monopoly layer. Phase 1 is PURE STATUS: the deed,
// its name, its map plot and its provenance are all status, so NO `transactions` row is ever written,
// the reason vocabulary is unchanged, and the nightly §10.4 sweep stays drift-0 BY CONSTRUCTION (the
// test asserts zero ledger rows across the whole flow — the portrait/dynasty/estate precedent).
//
// ACCOUNT-level (keyed on account_id) → SURVIVES DEATH: your characters die, the street stays yours;
// the heir inherits it (outside the runEstate wipe by construction — the death-disposition guard scans
// character_id-keyed tables, never account_id-keyed ones). CONTROL — rent (B, the corner take) and
// turf (C, the controller's perks — Phase 2C, loaded in game.js/loadOwned and OR'd with family turf
// at the perk sites) — is earned and defended IN-GAME; the on-chain tradeable token is Phase 3.
// Deliberately NOT wired into the live mint / the `minted` extraction flag,
// so the Sybil/extraction machinery is untouched (design §8).
