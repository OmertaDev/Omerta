// THE BROKERS — treasury-funded RWA rewards to NFT holders.
// Design: `omerta-brokers-design.md`. Founder-directed 2026-08-10.
//
// ── WHAT IS HERE, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Steps 3 and 4 of the design's order of work — the ACTIVATION sink and the EPOCH ALLOCATOR — plus,
// since 2026-08-15, THE DISTRIBUTION (`distributeBuy`): the one link that turns a real buy's units
// into `stock_allocations` rows pro-rata over an epoch's published weights. Activation is a
// recurring $OMR sink the late game has wanted since the audits first flagged supply pooling into
// staking; the allocator computes and publishes the weights; the distribution writes the OWED
// ledger the delivery rail consumes.
//
// **NOTHING HERE ACQUIRES, HOLDS, OR DELIVERS A SECURITY.** No stock is bought (that is the keeper,
// step 5), and nothing here moves stock on-chain: `distributeBuy` writes account-keyed BOOKKEEPING
// (the vault-ledger shape — an allocation is a ledger row, not a stranded on-chain balance), and it
// is dormant by construction pre-mainnet, because only a REAL buy's units exist to split and real
// buys need a real DEX. Delivery — the act the launch checklist gates — is `src/stockdeliver.js`'s
// keeper + the Delivered watcher, behind their own env walls.
//
// ── §10.4 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The only value that moves is the activation burn: `brokers:activate`, an $OMR SINK through the
// audited `spendOmr` till. It is in `DESK.SINK_REASONS`, so since economy v3 it RECYCLES to the desk
// shelf like every other sink rather than being destroyed — the paired `desk:recycle` row means
// conservation needs no new term. Nothing here mints.

/// nothing wrote `stock_allocations` from the weights side. `u_a = U × w_a / Σw`, floored at the
/// 6dp grid (the remainder stays unallocated in held — never rounded up into somebody's line), each
/// share written through the audited `allocateStock` so the `allocated ≤ held` clamp applies to
/// every row this function ever writes.
///
/// ── THE FROZEN-WEIGHTS RULE, which is §8's anti-windfall rule in the brokers shape ──────────────
/// A buy distributes ONLY to the latest epoch published BEFORE the buy was recorded
/// (`computed_at <= buy.created_at`). The allocator reads LIVE activations at publish time, so an
/// epoch published AFTER a buy could include someone who saw the buy land and activated to catch
/// it — rewarding waiting out the town, which is exactly what the design's "no roll-forward" rule
/// forbids. The ops order is therefore publish → buy → distribute, and it is stated on the mod
/// route; a buy with no frozen epoch (or a weightless one) CONSUMES its latch with zero
/// allocations — the silent-epoch rule: those units sit in the treasury's held, claimable by
/// nobody, rather than becoming a retroactive jackpot for tomorrow's activators.
///
/// ── WHY THERE IS NO `allocated ≤ Σ distributed` INVARIANT beside the nightly wall ───────────────
/// The design's invariant list names "allocations grow only from a buy's pro-rata split", and the
/// tempting enforcement is a nightly check. Deliberately not added: the treasury suite's wall tests
/// seed allocations DIRECTLY (that is how you test a clamp), a QA comp path may too, and an alarm
/// that fires on expected states is one people learn to ignore (the desk-dark lesson). The single-
/// writer discipline is enforced where it can be exact instead — the latch here, the clamp in
/// `allocateStock`, and `allocated ≤ held` nightly, which bounds the damage of any writer absolutely.
///
