// THE POPULATION — NPC residents of the city. Design: omerta-npc-population-design.md.
//
// OMERTÀ is a multiplayer game launching with ~zero players, so every board that reads `characters`
// is dead in an empty alpha: the streets roster, the contract board, the duelling ladder, the Black
// Market, the Shylock, the bodyguard market, the nightlife board, the fights, the races strip, the
// fade/poker tables, the Wire's tap targets, Secrets' dig targets. The progression harness measured
// the consequence exactly — a plausible player reaches level 128 with $51M in 30 days having never
// once met another person, because there is nobody to meet.
//
// A resident is a REAL character (the convoys.is_npc precedent): a real `accounts` +
// `account_persistent` + `characters` row, flagged on both levels. That means every interaction a
// player has with a resident — a jump, a contract, a fire-kill, a wiretap, a dig, a DM — runs the
// SAME audited code that runs against a real player. Nothing in social.js knows it's fighting a ghost.
//
// §10.4: residents hold cash, so they sit inside the per-character cash check and every dollar they
// hold must have an enumerated reason. Exactly two new ones, both under the `npc:` cash prefix:
//   npc:seed    FAUCET — the cash a resident is spawned holding (the one new faucet; sim P9.21)
//   npc:retire  SINK   — the cash burned when the worker retires a resident
// Everything else is an existing audited flow: a fire-kill loots them through `whack:loot`, the
// estate burns the remainder through the existing death rows, the heir's stake is `death:legacy`.
//
// DEATH IS DELIBERATELY NOT SPECIAL. A killed resident runs the ordinary runEstate, and the heir —
// same name, generation+1 — IS the respawn. social.js needs zero changes and the population
// self-heals. The worker only tops up headcount and retires old bloodlines.
