// ── STREET DEEDS on-chain (omerta-street-deeds-design.md §2/§3) ────────────────────────────────
// The deed rail: extract a named street as a StreetDeed ERC-721, and re-import it (burn) back into the
// game. THE ONE STRUCTURAL RULE (design §0): the DEED transfers on-chain, the game's `minted` EXTRACTION
// entitlement and the rent/turf CONTROL do NOT. A deed is INERT while extracted (the car/boat precedent):
// its legend is PRESERVED and travels with the token — the value — and to play the rent/turf game with
// it again its holder RE-IMPORTS it (burn → the Redeemed watcher re-keys it to the burner's account).
//
// §10.4-NEUTRAL by construction: a deed is ownership, never a §10.4 currency — every function here
// writes ZERO `transactions` rows. The three states of a deed row:
//   1. in-game       account_id = A (real),   onchain_token_id = NULL          — fully playable
//   2. extract-pending account_id = A (real),  onchain_token_id = <token>       — INERT; A can't claim
//        a new street (still holds this row) until the on-chain claim lands (Extracted watcher) or the
//        voucher expires (sweep clears it → state 1). This closes the double-dispose window: A can't
//        list/sell/collect the deed off-chain AND mint the NFT for the same street.
//   3. on-chain      account_id = 'onchain:<token>', onchain_token_id = <token> — A freed; the NFT is
//        in a wallet, tradeable; the row (+ its legend) persists to reserve the name and preserve the
//        story until someone RE-IMPORTS it (state 3 → 1 on the burner).

// ══ THE STRANDED-VAULT RECOVERY — a burned deed nobody can re-mint (founder-directed 2026-08-16) ══
//
// Burning a deed FREEZES its ERC-6551 vault, it never empties it: the account's address is a pure
// function of the tokenId, the tokenId is keccak(NAME), and nothing ever deletes a `street_deeds` row
// or frees its unique `name_lc` — so the id is permanently reserved and re-minting that same street
// restores control with the contents intact (`StreetDeed.t.sol` proves the same-id re-mint). In the
// ORDINARY case this needs nobody: `applyDeedReimport` leaves the row `pending` when the burner has no
// linked wallet or already holds a street, and `sweepDeedReimports` retries it every tick, forever.
//
// The case that never resolves is a burn from a wallet that will NEVER link — a lost key, a redeem
// sent from the wrong address, a player who does not come back. The re-import waits indefinitely,
// nobody in-game holds the deed, so nothing re-mints the id and real stock sits frozen at a known
// address with no route to it. This is that route, and it needs NO contract change: `claim()` accepts
// any server-signed DeedVoucher and derives the tokenId from the name.
//
// FOUR WALLS, because the lever is strong (the signer can already mint any name anywhere — this adds
// no authority, but a routed, documented path makes it USABLE, which is the part that needs bounding):
//   1. THE DESTINATION IS FIXED. It recovers to `DEED_RECOVERY_ADDRESS` — a treasury holding address —
//      and takes no address from the caller (founder decision). So the route cannot be talked into
//      "I lost my key, mint my street to this new wallet": returning a recovered deed to a player is a
//      separate, deliberate act by whoever holds the treasury, not something this can be aimed.
//   2. ONLY A GENUINELY STRANDED DEED. There must be a `deed_reimports` row still `pending` for the
//      token — that row IS the evidence the burn happened and the re-import cannot land — and the deed
//      must still be in the on-chain state. A live, owned deed is not recoverable, i.e. this can never
//      be a confiscation. (The contract backstops it anyway: `_safeMint` reverts on an existing id, so
//      a voucher for a deed that was NOT burned is unclaimable.)
//   3. NOT BEFORE `RECOVER_AFTER_MS`. A burn minutes old is not stranded, it is in flight — the sweep
//      may still land it. The wait is what distinguishes the two.
//   4. IT SUPERSEDES THE PENDING RE-IMPORT. Otherwise the sweep could later re-key the deed to the
//      burner while the treasury holds the NFT — a split brain where two parties each believe they
//      own the street (the stale-state-survives-a-lifecycle-reset class the C4 fix was about).
// Mod-gated, so it lands in `mod_actions` like every other mod mutation. §10.4-NEUTRAL: a voucher and
// an ownership move, zero `transactions` rows.

// that is where the levers live and a restatement here is the class preflight's own ledger exists to
// stop.
//
// THE CLASS: a value the CHAIN holds authoritatively and the backend keeps its own copy of. RT#6 hit
// it once (`ALCHEMIST_ASSET_DECIMALS`, deleted), RT#9 hit it again (`STOCK_TOKEN_DECIMALS`, deleted)
// and found F1's two splits; enumerating the whole class turned up five instances, so the fix is one
// crossing that reads them all rather than a sixth ad-hoc guard:
//
//   • `OmertaFees.vigBps` — the SHARP one. `MintFeePaid` carries the gross ALONE, so
//     `recordVigRevenue` DERIVES the share from `VIG_BPS`: a divergence directly mis-books the
//     withdrawal reserve's funding source, and every downstream check sums either way because they
//     all descend from the same restated number.
//   • `OmertaBond.polBps/devBps/rwaBps` — IMMUTABLE, so a typo is permanent. The booking here is
//     event-authoritative (`Bonded` carries all four), so what diverges is the DECLARED waterfall.
//   • `OmertaFees.mintFee` / `respawnFee` — settable, and they move at a tranche boundary. The
//     respawn one prices a LIVE rail (plexQuote), so a stale copy sets a price nobody chose.
//   • `VoucherClaim.dailyCapOMR` — a stale-HIGH copy signs exactly the voucher its own guard exists
//     to prevent: burned $OMR behind a `claim()` that reverts every day until the reclaim sweep.
//   • `OMR` / `OmertaHook` sell-tax bps — `recordSellTax` derives all four slices from the levers.
//
// Everything is read through `opt()` so a getter missing on an older deploy costs one comparison
// rather than the whole sweep.
