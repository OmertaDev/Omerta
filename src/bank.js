// THE CITY LEG — protocol profit buys $OMR, and the players who PLAY receive it.
// (`omerta-bank-protocol-design.md` §4.1–§4.3. Founder-directed 2026-08-10: "make it so the OMR
// bought from the profit only funds the game the players who play.")
//
// The Bank's other half was already here — the contracts, the `bank_revenue` ledger that harvest
// fees land in, and `ACTIVITY` in the rules tail, locked and pinned by `test/activity.js`. What was
// missing is the thing that connects them: nothing turned revenue into $OMR, and nothing handed
// that $OMR to anybody. This is that, and it is the flywheel the whole design is for —
// **borrowers who pay fund the players who don't**.
//
// ── THE TWO RULES, AND WHY EACH IS A CHECK RATHER THAN A POLICY ─────────────────────────────────
//
// RULE 1 — the bought $OMR is EXCLUSIVELY for in-game distribution to players. It never reaches
// NFT holders, stakers, or the team; those legs are funded from the ETH/stable side of the split
// and never from this one. Stated that way it is a promise. Stated as `Σ bought == Σ distributed`
// it is an identity a nightly runner asserts, which is what `runBankInvariants` does below.
//
// RULE 2 — the recipients are defined by PLAYING. Not by not-paying: "free player" is a status you
// hold by doing nothing, and a farm of accounts that never play is exactly that. The key IS the
// playing, so the farm receives nothing without becoming a player first.
//
// ── LINEAR AND UNCAPPED, WHICH IS NOT A PREFERENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Pro-rata on the activity score with NO per-account cap. This project already measured and paid
// for the alternative (BALANCE.md § THE FARM): the Street Wage's `WAGE_CAP_OMR` was commented
// "anti-Sybil" and did the opposite — a per-individual cap clips the honest whale and hands the
// remainder to whoever runs more accounts, because the only way around a per-individual cap is to
// BE several individuals. The general law:
//
//   concave (a cap, a log-share) → splitting effort across N accounts GAINS      → Sybil-POSITIVE
//   linear                       → splitting gains exactly nothing               → Sybil-NEUTRAL ✔
//
// So the Sybil bound is not a cap; it is the game's own clocks. Every tag in `ACTIVITY.TAGS` is
// throttled by nerve, energy or a cooldown, so a farm's cost and its reward are both linear in N —
// identical ROI to an honest player. `test/bank.js` asserts the split-is-neutral property directly,
// because it is the one an added cap would silently break.
//
// The breadth gate (`MIN_TRACKS`) is the opposite shape and belongs: it is a fixed cost per ACCOUNT,
// so it is Sybil-NEGATIVE, and it never clips an honest player's payout.
//
// ── §10.4 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE reason, and it is not a new one: `prize:omr`, which `invariants.js` already documents as "an
// in-game $OMR credit BACKED by hard $OMR moved into the withdrawal reserve — admissible because real
// revenue backs every token". Wall 1 (no faucet) survives intact, because every token handed to a
// player was BOUGHT, not printed — and now, additionally, bought for somebody who was playing.
//
// The backing is asserted from both directions, and that needed care: `fundReserve` has a two-sided
// sandwich in `runVigInvariants` naming every legitimate funder BY NAME, so a new one that is not
// added to both terms does not fail open — it fires SPURIOUSLY, on both halves at once. That is the
// desk's lesson (AUDIT-desk F1) and `cityPaid` is threaded there in the same commit as this file.

///     `prize:omr` MINT followed by `fundReserve`, i.e. the assertion "hard $OMR arrived and stands
