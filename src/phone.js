// THE CELLPHONE (founder-directed): a personal inbox + player-to-player DIRECT MESSAGES.
// Two halves, both pure talk — ZERO §10.4 surface (no currency ever rides the phone):
//   THE INBOX  — the existing `notifications` stream (every "something happened TO you" event:
//                convoy jacked, contract posted, tribute due, fee credited, …) surfaced as a
//                readable list WITHOUT flipping `delivered` (that flag belongs to the WS backfill —
//                the phone PEEKS; GET /v1/notifications remains the one delivery-marking read).
//   THE LINE   — DMs between players, ACCOUNT-keyed on both sides so a thread survives death and
//                rename (the bloodline keeps its phone; the heir picks it up). Name snapshots per
//                line (the troll-box discipline); the counterpart's CURRENT living street is
//                resolved for display + reply targeting.
// Discipline: cleanText + 240-char clamp + a 2s per-account flood brake (the postChat trio);
// self-DM blocked; a recipient with no living street still receives (the heir reads it later).
// Retention: the worker's 30-day sweep. STEP TWO: BLOCKED LINES — `dm_blocks`, account-level both
// sides (a block outlives death: you blocked the BLOODLINE; the heir stays blocked until you
// relent). A blocked sender gets an honest 'blocked' (no silent drop — this is a mafia game, they
// can know you hung up on them); blocking someone also stops YOU messaging them ('you_blocked',
// unblock to talk). Blocks gate only DMs — game events (a jump, a contract) still notify: you can
// mute a man's mouth, never the city.
