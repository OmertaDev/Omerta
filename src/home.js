// THE HOME AGGREGATE — one read for the screen a returning player lands on.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Home was measured at 19 requests a tick — the worst screen in the game, and the
// one a returning player is sent to (THE HOME drop made it the landing screen deliberately). Sixteen
// of those nineteen are authed board GETs fired from one render, and TWELVE of them each call
// `readCharacter`. `src/aggregate.js` carries the full argument and the isolation mechanics; this
// file is the MAP and nothing else.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, and why that is correct rather than a compromise. `bulletinBoard` WRITES — it
// materialises the week's snapshot the first time a player picks the bulletin up — and the read path
// refuses writes. So `/v1/bulletin` stays its own fetch: the honest scope is 16 board GETs become 2,
// not 1. That constraint is also the PROOF for the fifteen below (see test/home.js).
