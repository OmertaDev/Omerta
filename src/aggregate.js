// THE BOARD AGGREGATOR — the shared core behind every screen that folds its reads into one.
//
// WHY A SHARED CORE RATHER THAN A COPY. The isolation logic below is twenty subtle lines, and the
// subtlety is all in the failure paths — which is exactly the shape this project has been bitten by:
// `sackEmpire` copied a column list instead of calling the helper and the rake cursor drifted; three
// gate predicates ended up with sixty-nine private copies because writing the comparison locally was
// the reasonable thing to do at each site. A second aggregate reproducing this by hand would agree
// with the first today and diverge on the first fix that reaches only one of them.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. `tools/pollcost.js` measures what one IDLE player costs, because the server
// ceiling is in requests and the player ceiling is that divided by the per-player cost. A screen that
// fans out to N board GETs pays N times: N connection acquisitions, N transactions and N reads of the
// same character row — and on the locked path each takes that row FOR UPDATE, so a client firing them
// in a `Promise.all` has them QUEUE ON EACH OTHER'S LOCK. One read does the work of all of them.
//
// EVERY ROUTE FOLDED IN HERE STAYS MOUNTED. Agents poll them (AGENTS.md), the client wiring guard
// fetches them one at a time, `/v1/screens` beacons them. An aggregate is a second door onto the same
// rooms, never a replacement for the doors that exist.
//
// WHAT CANNOT RIDE ALONG. `readCharacter` prefers a no-BEGIN path whose client REFUSES writes
// (game.js `readOnlyClient`), so a board that WRITES — one that materialises a row the first time you
// look at it — cannot be in a map. That is a constraint rather than a compromise, and it is also the
// PROOF for the boards that are: the read path answering at all is what shows none of them is quietly
// changing something. A writing board keeps its own fetch.
//
// SEQUENTIAL, NOT PARALLEL. These share ONE pooled connection and node-pg cannot run two queries at
// once on it (test/gates.js THE CONNECTION-SHARING LEDGER: it queues them behind a deprecation today
// and THROWS from pg@9). Handing each board its own connection is the other wrong answer — it would
// read outside the request's transaction, and N connections per request is the pool-exhaustion shape
// this project has been bitten by twice. Sequential is correct AND identical in speed.

// THE ENVELOPE OWNS THESE NAMES. `readCharacter` returns `{ character, ...board }`, and the spread
// is LAST — so a board keyed `character` SILENTLY replaces the envelope's own field, on exactly the
// screens that fold boards and nowhere else, invisible to every per-route check (the contract block
// compares a key against its own route, where both sides are the board and agree perfectly). Found
// by reading a production response and counting: 15 boards, 14 keys. The colliding key then was
// `events` — the envelope carried a DEAD `events: []` that nothing in `src/` ever pushed to, so the
// shadowing was harmless by luck and the field was removed (2026-09-05) rather than reserved forever.
// `events` is a LEGAL board key now (`/v1/people/history/:characterId` owns it — a timeline is the
// right word for one). `boards`/`failed` are this function's own summary fields and stay reserved.
// Validated ONCE per map (a WeakSet) rather than on every request: it is a static property of the
// map, and a hot-path check for something that cannot change between requests is a slower request.
const RESERVED = new Set(['character', 'boards', 'failed']);
// Validated ONCE per map, not per request — it is a static property of the map, and a check that runs
// on the hot path to prove something that cannot change between requests is just a slower request.

  // mechanics: `readCharacter`'s fast path has no BEGIN, so a failed statement kills only itself and a
  // plain catch is enough — but the LOCKED fallback (taken whenever accrual moved, i.e. most first
  // renders) runs in a transaction, where a failed statement aborts the WHOLE transaction (25P02) and
  // every board after it. Hence a savepoint there.
  // The savepoint is ATTEMPTED per call and never assumed: pg-mem cannot parse one at all, and a
  // module-wide cache of "do savepoints work here" is the bug AUDIT-street-life fixed in
  // `recordContact` — whichever context ran first decided it for every later caller. Taking it
