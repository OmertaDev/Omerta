// the earnings figures SUM ledger rows the referral machinery already writes, they move nothing.
// Attribution mechanics, so the numbers are LEDGER-EXACT rather than re-derived:
//  • CASH is per-character. Recruiter-side rows are `referral:recruiter` + `referral:spark`
//    (both carry `counterparty` = the recruit's character id) plus the un-attributed ladder
//    bonuses `referral:milestone` / `referral:tier2`. The recruit's OWN welcome money
//    (`referral:recruit`, and the NULL-counterparty `referral:spark` twin) is never counted —
//    that was earned by being recruited, not by recruiting.
//  • $OMR is HISTORICAL as of 2026-07-31 — referrals no longer pay any (founder-directed; what a
//    recruit pays now is THE CREW BONUS, a respect multiplier, which is not a currency and writes no
//    ledger row). The sum stays because a live database still holds real pre-retirement rows: both
//    sides shared the `referral:fund` reason, so the player's own welcome bonus (exactly

//    as recruiting income. On a fresh database this is simply 0.
