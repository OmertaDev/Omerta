# OMERTÀ — The Gambling Den (detailed design)

**Status: DRAFT → building step one.** The genre's most glaring absence: we have a casino
*business* but nobody can gamble. The Den adds player-vs-house games — the noir staples — as a
**recurring, voluntary, entertainment-priced cash sink** with bounded cash accounting.

## 1. Hard rules (non-negotiable guardrails)

1. **CASH ONLY. Never $OMR.** Gambling with an extractable token is a hard line we do not
   cross regardless of launch posture on the rest of the pivot. The Den's tables take pocket
   cash; no route touches `account_persistent.omr` in any direction. (The PLEX/extraction rail
   stays exactly as boring as a withdrawal should be.)
2. **Server-authoritative randomness, audited.** Every roll is server-side and written to
   `rng_audit` (ground rule #3). The client sends a *choice* (bet size, pick), never an outcome.
3. **Ledgered both ways.** Every stake is a §10.4 cash SINK (`casino:bet:<game>`), every payout a
   FAUCET (`casino:win:<game>`), both with `character_id` — the per-character cash check
   reconciles automatically; the house's margin is simply sink − faucet over volume.
4. **The street gets a funded cut.** `takeHouse` caps the street's cash allocation by realized
   house profit net of open liabilities. Unallocated house profit is a game-cash sink. These cash
   movements do not buy OMR, pay personal staking yield or create protocol liquidity.

## 2. The games (step one)

### 2.1 Street craps — `POST /v1/casino/dice { amount }`
The classic pass-line round, resolved in ONE server call (no table state): first roll 7/11 wins,
2/3/12 craps out, anything else sets the point and the server keeps rolling until the point
(win) or a 7 (loss). Pays 1:1. **House edge ≈ 1.41%** — the authentic number, thin enough that
dice are entertainment, not a wealth tax. The full roll sequence returns in the response and the
round is one `rng_audit` row. Costs `DICE_NERVE` (1) nerve — gambling takes nerve, and it's a
gentle natural rate limit on top of §10.2.

### 2.2 The Numbers — `POST /v1/casino/numbers { pick, amount }` + `/claim`
The poor man's lottery the mob actually ran. Pick a number 0–999, stake $10–$1,000, one ticket
per street per day. The day's winning number draws from the server-secret market seed
(`hash01('numbers:' + day + ':' + MARKET_SEED)` — same machinery as §7.11 prices, unpredictable
without the seed, verifiable after the fact). Pays **600:1** on true odds of 999:1 — the
historically accurate ~40% edge; it's a flutter, priced like one. Tickets resolve lazily:
`POST /v1/casino/numbers/claim` settles every matured ticket (wins credit `casino:win:numbers`;
losing tickets just close). `GET /v1/casino` shows yesterday's number, your open tickets, and
the table limits.

## 3. Placement & gates
- **Located at the Neon Mile** (`CASINO_DISTRICT: 'neon'` — the vice district; travel there to
  play). Gives neon a second identity beyond its income perk and keeps vice geographically
  contestable. Family turf does NOT substitute (the den is the den).
- Gates: jailed → no (prison dice comes with the prison update), bets clamped to
  `[CASINO_MIN_BET $100, CASINO_MAX_BET $250k]` per roll (variance ceiling — a whale can't
  swing $10M on one point), numbers `[NUMBERS_MIN $10, NUMBERS_MAX $1k]`.
- Idempotency-Key + the standard rate buckets apply (the routes live under `/v1` like every
  mutating player route).

## 4. Economy notes
- Expected sink at scale: dice volume × 1.41% + numbers volume × 40%, minus the 1% street cut
  (a transfer, not a burn). Both games are strictly −EV; the Den adds no earning loop, so it
  cannot disturb the sim-audited faucet curves — it only drains discretionary cash and feeds
  the buyback. (The audit's endgame problem is too much passive cash: the Den is a voluntary
  drain that scales with exactly the players who have the most.)
- Win streak risk is bounded by the max bet, and the numbers payout is bounded by
  `NUMBERS_MAX × 600 = $600k/street/day` worst-case (an acceptable faucet tail; the EV is
  strongly negative).
- All numbers (`CASINO` block in the rules tail) are founder sign-off levers.

## 5. Step two (BUILT)
- **Back-room dice (PvP)** — consent-by-listing, the bodyguard-market pattern: a fader posts an
  open limit (`POST /v1/casino/fade {limit}`, 0 clears; surfaced on the den board + their view),
  a challenger at the den rolls against them (`POST /v1/casino/dice/:targetId {amount}`, runs
  under `withTwoCharacters` — no escrow, one atomic transaction). One symmetric 2d6 hi-roll,
  ties reroll (a fair 50/50); the winner takes the pot minus `PVP_RAKE_BPS` (5%) — half the rake
  to the street-tax pool, half burns. Ledger: loser −stake / winner +(stake − rake), both
  `casino:pvp` with counterparties — a pure transfer with a house take, §10.4-exact. A jailed,
  hospitalized, or away-from-neon fader is `unavailable`.
- **The fight** — a weekly NPC bout (fighters drawn per week from the seed): one bet per street
  per week, **capped at `FIGHT_MAX` ($5k)** — the cap is the fix's structural abuse bound.
  Favorite wins at `FIGHT_FAV_P` (65%) off the seed draw; payouts `FIGHT_FAV_PAYS` 1.45 /
  `FIGHT_DOG_PAYS` 2.6 (a ~6–9% book edge). Bets settle lazily (`POST /v1/casino/fight/claim`).
  **THE FIX**: the boss/underboss of the family holding the Neon Mile buys the result once a
  week (`POST /v1/casino/fight/fix {winner}`) for `FIGHT_FIX_COST` ($50k) from the TREASURY (a
  §10.4 treasury sink, `casino:fix`, reconciled in the treasury check) — a turf perk with teeth,
  bounded by the bet cap (a fixed bout mints at most stake × payout per conspirator).
- **Casino-front rakeback** — owners of a `casino` BUSINESS split `RAKEBACK_BPS` (1%) of den
  stake volume (dice + numbers + fight + PvP pots), claimed at business collect, cursor-tracked
  per front (`rake_cursor` — a new owner earns against future action, not history; ledgered
  `casino:rakeback`). The Den feeds the Business Empire layer.
- **The high-stakes room** — at level `HIGH_LVL` (30) the PvE table takes up to `HIGH_MAX` ($2M)
  a roll; pots ≥ `HIGH_FEED` ($250k) hit the public streets feed (whale theater).

## Step three — the TABLE GAMES (BUILT)

Real table games at the Neon Mile, on the audited den-book accounting (no new emission — the house
edge is booked as profit and the street is tipped only from realized profit; on average both games
are house-favorable, i.e. a SINK). CASH ONLY (the hard line). All numbers are founder sign-off
levers (`CASINO.BJ_*`, `CASINO.POKER_MIN`).

- **Blackjack (stateful PvE)** — a real hand you play out. `POST /v1/casino/blackjack {amount}` deals
  (bet taken + profit-booked at deal, `casino:bet:blackjack`); the hand persists in `blackjack_hands`
  (one live hand per street) across `POST /v1/casino/blackjack/hit|stand|double` — each its own atomic
  txn under `withCharacter` — until it resolves and the payout (if any) credits (`casino:win:blackjack`).
  Infinite deck (independent draws, the same server RNG as dice, rng-audited); dealer stands on
  `BJ_DEALER_MIN` (17) and hits SOFT 17 (`BJ_HIT_SOFT_17` — the authentic ~0.6% edge); a natural pays
  3:2 (`BJ_PAYS_BPS` 15000). Double is a first-two-cards move (stakes a second bet, one card, auto-stand).
  Same book accounting as dice (bumpProfit / profit-capped `takeHouse` / bumpVolume). Dies with the
  street (`blackjack_hands` joined the runEstate wipe).
- **Heads-up Hold'em (PvP showdown)** — consent-by-listing: a dealer posts a `poker_limit`
  (`POST /v1/casino/poker/deal {limit}` — the fade pattern, a new persisted character column). A
  challenger antes an equal stake (`POST /v1/casino/poker/:targetId {amount}`, `withTwoCharacters`);
  both are dealt 2 hole + a shared 5-card board (a real 52-card shuffle), best 5-of-7 wins the pot minus
  `PVP_RAKE_BPS` (5%, half → street tax / half burns — the back-room-dice mechanism, `casino:pvp`,
  §10.4-exact per character). A tie splits (stakes returned, no rake, no money moves). ONE atomic
  showdown — no multi-street betting (turn-based sessions are deferred). Gates: both at neon, dealer
  available, stake ≤ limit, both cover it, not self.

**Deferred (step four candidates):** true multi-way ring poker + a live scheduled TOURNAMENT with a
prize pool (both need turn-based session state this atomic one-call architecture doesn't hold),
blackjack splits/insurance, a poker sit-n-go.

## Step four — THE POKER TOURNAMENT (BUILT)

A scheduled, escrow-funded, worker-resolved SHOWDOWN — the boxing main-event pattern (the atomic
one-txn-per-action model can't hold turn-based play, so the tournament is a pooled competition, not
live hands). CASH only. A pure competitive REDISTRIBUTION (no new emission — the field is net-negative
by the house rake). All numbers are founder sign-off levers (`CASINO.TOURNEY.*`).

- **Buy in** (`POST /v1/casino/tournament`) — a fixed `BUYIN` ($5k) ESCROWS into the pool during an
  open registration window (`REGISTER_MS`, `TOURNEY_MS` env TEST-ONLY). At most ONE open tournament at
  a time (`poker_state.current`); a fresh one materializes on the next entry after the last settles.
  Gates: at neon, not jailed, not already seated, registration still open (`closed` past the window).
- **The worker settles** (`sweepTournaments` → `resolveTournament`) — deals every LIVE entrant an
  INDEPENDENT 7-card hand (a fresh shuffle each — scales to any field, no shared-board 52-card limit),
  ranks them best-5-of-7, and pays the top `min(field, PAYOUTS.length)` places a share of the pool net
  of `RAKE_BPS` (5%). Shares are RENORMALIZED to the field, so the house edge stays the rake regardless
  of turnout (an unpaid place doesn't leak its share to the take). Ties split the covered places' shares.
  A dead entrant's stake BURNS (`casino:tourney:death`); a field below `MIN_ENTRANTS` (2) is refunded
  (`casino:tourney:refund`). Single-writer (no player-lock races), idempotent (status gate).
- **§10.4** — a NEW escrow check (the boxing-bet-escrow twin): open-tournament pool ==
  Σ `casino:tourney:buyin` − `:win` − `:refund` − `:take` (NULL, half street tax / half burns) −
  `:death` (NULL). All ride the `casino:` prefix (no vocab change); the exact-reason matches sit under
  the `casino:bet:%`/`casino:win:%` den-profit LIKE patterns, so a tournament never touches the PvE
  house book. Lock order: char → `poker_state` → tournament (enter); entrant chars sorted → tournament
  (settle) — both acquire char(s) before the tournament row, acyclic.

The step-four deferred items (true multi-way ring poker with live betting streets; a bracketed
multi-table tournament) still need turn-based session state; the pooled showdown is the tournament
this architecture supports.
