// THE BLOCK (/v1/block) — one read for the streets screen's seven boards.
//
// This is test/home.js's sibling and asserts the same three properties, because they are the three a
// consolidation can silently give up:
//   · THE CONTRACT — every key must be what that board's OWN route serves, value for value. The two
//     halves are checked by different things (the client mirror verifies the screen against
//     `/v1/block|<key>`; agents and /v1/screens use `/v1/<key>`), so a drift would leave one of those
//     audiences reading a board nothing has ever checked.
//   · ISOLATION — today a board that throws 500s its own request and the other six still render.
//   · READ-ONLY — the read path's client REFUSES writes, so a writing board cannot ride along at all.
//
// It also pins the two boards that do NOT arrive through `readCharacter`, since both are exceptions
// somebody could later "tidy up" into a bug: `/v1/market/prices` is keyless and pure (in the map
// because the ceiling is measured in requests), and `/v1/daily` reads through its querier argument —
// handing it the request's own write-refusing client is stricter than the route it mirrors.
