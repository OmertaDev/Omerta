// THE GATE MATRIX — sibling verbs must not forget a gate their twin enforces.
//
// This is the single most productive bug class in this project's history, and it keeps recurring
// because the gates live at each call site rather than in one place:
//   • `jump` was missing the unreachable-victim gates `fire` had (AUDIT-full-system-v3)
//   • `collectFrontier` was missing the signed D2 safehouse gate `collectTerritory` enforces
//     (AUDIT-world-frontier F1)
//   • `npcHit` was blind to the Pen shields, so a $25k burner beat the yard boss's protection
//     (AUDIT-the-pen-step-two)
//   • `payProtection` let a PROTECTED inmate shank with impunity (AUDIT-the-pen)
// Every one of those was found by a person noticing an asymmetry. This asserts the asymmetry away.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS. Each FAMILY below declares the gates every member must enforce, and why. A gate
// counts as enforced if the function calls the helper, reaches it through an `assert*` helper it
// calls (the `assertStreetCrime` pattern — the RIGHT way to share a gate set), or writes the check
// INLINE against the same column. All three forms are live in the tree today; a matrix that saw
// only direct calls would report false positives and be ignored, which is worse than no check.
//
// AND IT CHECKS ITS OWN COMPLETENESS. A guard over a hand-written list quietly stops covering the
// code the moment somebody adds a verb — so the membership itself is derived and asserted: every
// street crime (anything routed through `assertStreetCrime`) and every `collect*` action must be
// declared in a family or exempted WITH a stated reason.
//
// Scope, honestly: this checks that a gate is REACHED, not that it is correct. `fire` calling
// `safeHoused(ch)` proves the shield is consulted, not that the comparison is the right way round.

//
// The rule, and why it is a rule rather than a list: a handful of cash faucets exist specifically to
// reward a HUMAN for showing up — a login streak, a mentor's protégé stake, a crew's weekly job, a
// nightly window, the corner, the hustle. Agents are excluded from every one of them by standing
// posture, and that exclusion is the whole anti-Sybil argument for those faucets existing at all.
//
// AND IT MUST BE CHECKED AT THE POINT OF PAYMENT, which is the finding worth keeping: `agent_flag`
// is set by the account's OWN call to /v1/auth/agent-key, so it is mutable at any moment. A gate at
// formation time — "you may not be offered a mentorship if you are an agent" — reads state that can
// change before the money moves, and `mentor` shipped exactly that: form the tie as a human, flip

// ═══ THE CONNECTION LEDGER — a pooled client that is taken must be given back ═══
//
// Found by the red team of 2026-08-16, and it is this file's own class exactly: `sweepNpcWars` and
// `sweepFamilyAggro` each took a connection per due row and never released it, while the three
// sibling sweeps a few hundred lines DOWN THE SAME FILE all release in a `finally` — and so do the
// other 105 `pool.connect()` sites in src/. Two of 109.
//
// Why it earns a hard check rather than a note. A leaked pooled client is not one slow request: it
// is PERMANENT and CUMULATIVE for the life of the process, so the damage is not proportional to the
// mistake. Measured on real Postgres (pool max 3, five due rows): three connections leaked, the
// sweep then threw `timeout exceeded when trying to connect` ON ITSELF at row four, and the next
// job to ask for a connection failed the same way. In production the worker's pool is 20, and the
// worker is the process that owns the nightly §10.4 sweep, the drift alarm, the backup watchdog and
// every timed settlement — so the failure mode is the whole background half of the game stopping,
// silently, with the alarms that would have told you about it stopped too.
//
// The rule is deliberately narrow so it stays true: every `const x = await pool.connect()` must
// have an `x.release()` before its enclosing function ends. It does NOT check that the release is
// in a `finally` — a few sites legitimately hold a connection across a whole job (the advisory-lock
// pattern) and release it on a later path — because a rule that flagged those would be noise, and
// noise gets deleted. Taking one and never giving it back is the thing that has no defensible form.

// "a future step that gives residents a legend must exclude them on that board at the same time" —
// and it was followed on five boards and forgotten on the rest, of which four were reachable:
//
//   • duels     — the ONE board with no `> 0` threshold: it ranks every living character on raw elo,
//                 and a resident's `duel_elo` DEFAULTS to ELO_START. Reproduced at 6 of 7 entries.
//   • bloodline — residents die normally, so each death writes a `bloodline` row; six generations of
//                 a boss-band line out-scored the only human on the server. Reproduced at score 520.
//   • heists    — `fillHeist` hires resident hands so a solo player can run crew content, and the
//                 success loop bumps `heists_pulled` for EVERY member row, hired ones included.

// ═══ THE CATALOG LEDGER — an object index is not an allowlist ════════════════════════════════════
//
// `if (!CATALOG[userInput]) throw` reads like a membership test and is not one: every JavaScript
// object inherits `__proto__`, `constructor`, `toString`, `valueOf` and `hasOwnProperty`, and each
// of those indexes TRUTHY. So the gate passes for exactly those keys and the value flows on.
//
// Found by the red team of 2026-08-17, driven through the real routes. Two of the five
// user-reachable gates were live defects: `KITCHEN.MODULES[modId]` reached a `lab_${modId}` COLUMN
// NAME and 500'd on it, and `MASTERY.TRAITS[traitId]` returned 200 and WROTE `trait_id='__proto__'`
// — permanently consuming the once-ever level-50 choice with a trait that then grants nothing.
// Injection was never possible (a quoted payload is not a prototype key, so the gate catches it),
// which is precisely what made the gate look adequate.
//
// The rule: a gate of the form `CATALOG[key]` where CATALOG is a module-level (SHOUTY) catalog and
// `key` is a variable must use `Object.hasOwn`. A waiver must say why the key cannot be
// user-supplied — a numeric index, a column read back out of our own database, a route name we
// generated. Scope: it proves the PREDICATE is right, not that the surrounding logic is.

// ═══ THE ABI LEDGER — the backend's event signatures must match the contracts' ════════════════════
//
// Every watcher decodes a log through a `parseAbiItem('event …')` string written by hand, against a
// declaration that lives in a different language in a different directory. Nothing crossed them
// until RT#9 did it once, by eye, and found a drift: `HarvestFeeTaken`'s third parameter is `assets`
// on-chain and was `amount` in the backend. That one was inert — viem decodes POSITIONALLY, so both
// sides being wrong together still worked — which is exactly why it survived: it could only be
// caught by comparing the two declarations, never by running either.
//
// WHY THE PARAMETER NAME IS THE POINT. A type-only comparison passes the drift that actually hurts:
// a SAME-TYPED ADJACENT SWAP. `Bonded` has six adjacent non-indexed `uint256` (principal, payout,
// toPol, toDev, toRwa, toVig); `Delivered` has two adjacent `address indexed`; `Extracted` has two
// adjacent `string`. Swap any neighbouring pair and every type still lines up, the topic hash is
// unchanged, viem decodes without complaint — and the backend books the POL slice as the dev slice,
// or delivers stock to the token instead of the recipient. Only the names disagree, so the names are
// what this checks.
//
// The indexed flag is checked for a different reason: it decides whether a field arrives in `topics`
// or in `data`, so getting it wrong is not a mis-labelling, it is a decode that silently yields the
// wrong value for every field after it.
//
// AND THE READER, which is the half a declaration check cannot see. `parseAbiItem` says what the
// log contains; the mapper below it says which field to take. Fix one and not the other and the
// read is `undefined` — silently, since viem returns no such key rather than throwing. So the
// second half binds every `l.args.X` to the event its own `getLogs({ event: … })` names, and
// requires X to be a parameter that event declares. That is what makes the rename above safe to
// have done: the ABI and its reader are now checked against each other, not merely each against
// itself.
{
  // an event the backend watches that no contract in this repo declares. Each must name its real

// ═══ THE LOCK LEDGER — one pair of rows, one order, everywhere ═══════════════════════════════════
//
// The most productive deadlock class in this project, and the only one that has been fixed the same
// way four separate times: two code paths take the same two `FOR UPDATE` locks in opposite orders.
// `pvpDice` locked street_tax before den_volume where the rest of the den locked them the other way;
// `refundPot` iterated funders unsorted; `payFamilyYield` locked the pool before the gangs while
// `runBuyback` writes it after them; the poker tournament locked its row before `poker_state`. Each
// was found by a person noticing an asymmetry, and each fix stated the canonical order in a comment —
// which is exactly as durable as the next person reading that comment.
//
// The sweep that produced this ledger found ONE surviving pair on a tree that had already had nine
// red teams over it: `callOutChamp` locked boxing_title→fighters where `acceptCallout` locks
// fighters→title. Its comment argued that was safe, on a precondition — "any counter-path that would
// lock this fighter must first block on the held caller char" — that `acceptCallout`, a function the
// same comment NAMED as canonical, violates in its own explicit words. Both were right about
// themselves and wrong about each other, which is the shape a per-site comment cannot catch.
//
// TWO RULES, and the second exists because the first is blind to it. (1) No pair of tables may be
// locked in both orders by any two transactions. (2) No SINGLETON may be locked before a `characters`
// row — because every player action already holds its own character via withCharacter before it ever
// reaches a pot, that implicit lock makes characters→singleton the universal order, and rule (1)
// cannot see a lock the enclosing wrapper took.
//
// SPLITTING ON TRANSACTION BOUNDARIES IS WHAT MAKES IT USABLE. A function may open several
// independent transactions — the ring sweep has two, a route-registration function has dozens — and
// concatenating them invents pairs no single transaction ever holds together. Without the split this
// sweep reported two false positives out of three, and a mostly-wrong advisory is worse than none.

// ═══ THE CONNECTION-SHARING LEDGER — one client cannot run two queries at once ═══════════════════
//
// Found by PLAYING (2026-08-18): the hustle card offered a CHECK IN that always refused, and adding
// the missing gate to `hustleBoard` surfaced a DeprecationWarning that traced straight into
// `dayBoard`'s `Promise.all` — five board readers issued CONCURRENTLY on ONE pooled client.
//
// node-pg cannot execute concurrent queries on a single connection. It queues them today behind
// `Calling client.query() when the client is already executing a query is deprecated`, and it
// THROWS from pg@9. So the parallel form is a false optimisation in both directions: it buys no
// speed (the one connection serializes them regardless) and it carries a latent hard break. It is
// also self-disguising — `career.js`'s own comment called it "one batched pass", which is precisely
// the belief that makes somebody write the next one.
//
// The fix is never "give each reader its own connection": these run inside a request's transaction,
// so a second connection reads outside its snapshot, and acquiring N per request is the
// pool-exhaustion shape this project has already been bitten by twice (`bankPosition`, `/v1/bank`).
// Sequential is correct AND identical in speed.
//
// Scope, stated honestly: this matches a `Promise.all` whose ELEMENTS mention an identifier the
// enclosing function takes as a pg client. A viem client (`watcher.js`'s `getLogs` batch) is
// genuinely concurrent and is not matched — it is not a pg connection. A `pool` is not matched
// either: `pool.query()` acquires its own connection per call, so that form is safe by design.

  // catalogue-or-declare: a `client` that is NOT a pg connection. viem batches real network reads

// was never scanned; and (2) a message that is a TERNARY or any expression rather than a bare backtick
// (`GameError('treasury', occupied ? \`…\` : \`…\`)`) is not matched at all — and the tree has many
// such messages (drop.js, gangs.js, dynasty.js, economy.js). Both are closed by extracting the FULL

// deeprun run" on the wire. The fix is always the same and always at the SOURCE — send the name with
// the id — which is why this is a guard rather than a sweep: the class has been paid for six separate
// times now (npcName, taskLabel, goodName, the cartels, drugs+goods, and the twelve fixed here), each
// time in a system nobody had driven yet, and each time one verb of a loop already had it right while
// its siblings did not. `heists.js` sent `job.name` on the PLAN and the id on all five terminal
// replies; `races.js` still emits `race: tier.name` to the STREETS feed while the racer's own reply
// carried the id. The town was told the name and the man who did it was told a key.
//
// The rule: inside a player-visible payload — a `return {…}` or a `notify(…, {…})`, never a `ledger`
// or `track` row — a property `k: X.id` must be accompanied by a display name in the same literal
// (`name`, `title`, `label`, or `<k>Name`), or be DECLARED below with the property that makes it safe.
// Two things make it checkable rather than a matter of taste. A HANDLE is named by convention
// (`carId`, `heistId`, `character_id`) and is skipped outright — that convention is the discriminator,
// so a field named for the thing rather than for its id is asserting it IS the thing. And the waivers
// are keyed on (file, key) rather than on a line: a line-keyed waiver rots on any edit above it, which
// is what the connection ledger's viem waivers cost once already.
//

// which drives the line and reads it back.
