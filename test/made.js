// THE FLOAT (economy v3 step 5) — THE MADE MAN, the tiered loot rate and the access stake.
// The 63rd suite. Design §5 (the holding problem), §11.1, §11.2, §11.5.
//
// The step exists because of one sentence: **a consumable you should never HOLD cannot be the loot
// that makes killing worth it.** So the assertions are aimed at the ways that could fail rather than
// at the happy path:
//
//   (1) THE DUES BUY POWER. The line that keeps the game free is that operating costs stay in CASH
//       and a subscription gates no earning loop's strength. The pad-pays-itself convenience is the
//       one that could drift: it must deduct the SAME cash and write the SAME ledger row, or it has
//       quietly become a discount.
//   (2) THE SINK DESTROYS SUPPLY. Since step 2 a sink hands its $OMR to the desk. A new sink that
//       forgets to recycle silently shrinks the shelf the auction sells from.
//   (3) THE FLOAT IS STILL SAFE SOMEWHERE. Staking used to be a safe harbour and §4.1 admits no
//       fourth way for $OMR to move, so "committed" has to mean CHEAPER, never FREE.
//
// pg-mem, zero infra. SQL-granting $OMR is an unledgered mint (the estate/portfolio precedent), so
// the $OMR-conservation DRIFT stays exactly the grant — which is what proves `made:dues` reconciles.
