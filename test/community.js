// ── THE COMMUNITY EARMARK + THE FAMILY BUYBACK — Phase 1 of the treasury→family split ────────────
// (`omerta-treasury-to-family-design.md` §4/§8; `src/community.js`.)
//
// The assertions aim at the five ways this could go wrong, not the happy path:
//
//   (1) PHASE 1 IS NOT BYTE-IDENTICAL. Every slice lever ships at ZERO, so with no env set the five
//       ingests must book EXACTLY what they booked before this drop existed — no community row, the
//       full harvest amount to the bank, the full POL fee to the buyback budget, a sell-tax episode
//       whose LP remainder is the original three-way split. A nonzero default is a silent production
//       balance change wearing a dormant feature's clothes.
//   (2) SUPPLY IS FABRICATED. `yield:buyback` is a MINT; a comp/QA call with a caller-supplied price
//       must book ZERO spend and ZERO $OMR (the bank posture, stricter than the desk's — the pool's
//       exit reaches real families), and the mod route must STRIP a txHash unless
//       ALLOW_MOD_REAL_REVENUE is on (the D-MED2 discipline).
//   (3) MORE GOES OUT THAN CAME IN. The keeper's root cap (`spend ≤ community revenue`, per
//       currency) is the wall; a comp consuming the budget would starve the real buy that follows.
//   (4) THE FLIP IS A SILENT SQUEEZE. The rules.tail.js load guard makes turning the sell-tax slice
//       on REQUIRE lowering a sibling scalar in the same deploy — proven in a subprocess, both ways.
//   (5) §10.4 DRIFTS. The mint has no counted-bucket debit, so it is admissible exactly to the
//       extent the exact `yield:buyback` reason is in omrMints (the kitchen:module class) — asserted
//       ABSOLUTE (this suite SQL-seeds no unledgered $OMR).
//
// pg-mem, zero infra. The five slice levers are FUNCTION-levers (env read per call), so they are set
// AFTER buildServer — setting SELL_TAX_COMMUNITY_BPS before rules.js loads would (correctly) refuse
// the boot via the four-way guard this suite proves in block 6.
