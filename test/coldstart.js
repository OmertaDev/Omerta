// ── LAUNCH DAY, SCALE 1 — the first player on a world with no history ───────────────────────────
//
// Every other guard here checks a system that HAS data. This one checks the opposite, because it is
// the state the game is actually in the hour it opens: no season has ended, no monument has been
// funded, no event has resolved, no leaderboard has anyone on it, and — with POPULATION_OFF — there
// is not even scenery to fill the boards. A board that divides by a total of zero, or reads `[0]` of
// an empty ranking, or assumes a `current` row exists, is correct in every test that seeds a fixture
// and 500s on the first person through the door.
//
// So: boot the emptiest possible world, create ONE character, and issue every authed GET the server
// mounts. Every one must answer 2xx, or be a DECLARED tombstone — a route deliberately kept mounted
// so a client that still calls it learns what happened instead of 404-guessing (the /v1/wage
// precedent). Catalog-or-declare, the same discipline as the client guard's NOT_API list: a new
// refusal is a decision on the record rather than a silent regression.
//
// This is deliberately the SERVER's half of a pair. `tools/mobile.js` drives the screens in a real
// browser and would catch a page that renders `undefined`; nothing before this asserted that the
// endpoints behind them answer at all when the world is empty.
process.env.MOD_KEY = 'test-mod-key';
process.env.POPULATION_OFF = 'on';   // no residents: the emptiest world the game can be in
