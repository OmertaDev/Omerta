// THE POPULATION test (the 47th suite) — NPC residents of the city.
// Design: omerta-npc-population-design.md. Covers: spawn (real character + flagged account, banded
// level/stats/cash), the §10.4 ledger discipline (npc:seed is a ledgered FAUCET so residents sit
// inside the per-character cash check exactly like a player; npc:retire burns what they carried),
// the worker top-up to TARGET, retirement of old bloodlines, presence on the streets roster with the
// flag EXPOSED, and — the four that matter most — that a resident never holds $OMR (the Street Wage
// was the sharp edge of that until the faucet retired), City Standing, ops and the onboarding funnel.
//
// NOTE ON SEEDING: this suite never SQL-seeds value. Resident cash arrives through the ledgered
// `npc:seed` faucet inside spawnResident, which is the whole point — the §10.4 assertions below are
// only meaningful because nothing here writes cash behind the ledger's back.
