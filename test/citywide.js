// CITYWIDE (/v1/citywide) — one read for the city screen's five AUTHED boards.
//
// The third of these, and the sibling of test/home.js and test/streets.js. It asserts the same three
// properties, because they are the three a consolidation can silently give up:
//   · THE CONTRACT — every key must be what that board's OWN route serves, value for value. The two
//     halves are checked by different things (the client mirror verifies the screen against
//     `/v1/citywide|<key>`; agents and /v1/screens use `/v1/<key>`), so a drift would leave one of
//     those audiences reading a board nothing has ever checked.
//   · ISOLATION — today a board that throws 500s its own request and the other four still render.
//   · READ-ONLY — the read path's client REFUSES writes, so a writing board cannot ride along at all.
//
// And one this file has that its siblings do not: `/v1/city` must STAY OUT. It is keyless and already
// carries two 30-second server-side caches, so folding it in would either duplicate those or recompute
// per player what is currently computed once for everybody — and it would close the door on
// edge-caching a public board. That is a decision, so it is pinned rather than left to a comment.
