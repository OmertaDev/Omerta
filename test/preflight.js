// The point of this file is the FIRST assertion: every `process.env.X` read anywhere in src/ must be
// classified in src/preflight.js. That is the durable fix for the thing this pass was written to
// find — the guards were fine, but the LIST of test-only knobs was a literal that drops kept
// forgetting to update. The pacing pass shipped TRAIN_CD_MS and MISSION_CD_MS (the two knobs that
// collapse the timers that stopped "level 240 in two hours") and neither was guarded; SOV_SIEGE_P,
// SOV_WINDOW_OPEN, SOLDIER_DEATH_P, BUSINESS_TAKEOVER_P, PEN_SHANK_CD_MS and SOCIAL_MATURE_MS had
// the same gap. Now a new knob cannot be forgotten — only classified.

// This is the test/migrate.js DISPOSITION guard applied to config instead of tables.
