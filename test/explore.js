// STILL ON THE TABLE — the cross-system pull: systems you've UNLOCKED by level and never touched.
//
// The centre of the test: a fresh street at a high level has unlocked many systems and TRIED none of
// them (so they're all "on the table"); engaging one — a single mastery-track XP row, the same signal
// the board reads — drops it from the untapped list and ticks the explorer tally. Pure read: a GET
// moves NO value (no ledger row) — the whole feature is §10.4-free by construction.
