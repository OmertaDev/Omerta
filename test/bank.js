// THE CITY LEG — the Bank's profit buys $OMR and the players who PLAY receive it.
// (`omerta-bank-protocol-design.md` §4.1–§4.3; `src/bank.js`.)
//
// The assertions here are aimed at the four ways this could go wrong, not at the happy path:
//
//   (1) THE SPLIT PAYS. The distribution is pro-rata LINEAR and UNCAPPED, and that is not a
//       preference — this project already measured and paid for the alternative (BALANCE.md § THE
//       FARM: the Street Wage's `WAGE_CAP_OMR` was commented "anti-Sybil" and did the opposite).
//       A cap is CONCAVE, and a concave payout means splitting one player's effort across N
//       accounts EARNS MORE than keeping it on one. So the centrepiece assertion is that splitting
//       gains exactly nothing — the property an added cap would silently break, which is precisely
//       why it is asserted rather than described.
//   (2) SUPPLY IS FABRICATED. `prize:omr` is a MINT, backed by `fundReserve` — the assertion "hard
//       $OMR arrived". A comp/QA buy that credited the pool would let the server sign a real
//       withdrawal against backing that does not exist.
//   (3) MORE GOES OUT THAN CAME IN. RULE 1 (`Σ distributed ≤ Σ bought`) is the wall; everything
//       else in the runner is books.
//   (4) THE WINDOW IS CONSUMED FOR NOTHING. `UNIQUE (start_day, end_day)` means an epoch row is
//       that day's only chance, so a sweep landing before the day's buy must not close it empty.
//
// pg-mem, zero infra.
