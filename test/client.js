// THE CLIENT'S WIRING (the 53rd suite).
//
// tools/mobile.js proves the screens LAY OUT. Nothing proved the buttons WORK. This does, for the
// three ways a control dies silently — all of which have shipped, repeatedly, and all of which were
// only ever caught by a person clicking through by hand:
//
//   1. THE ROUTE DOES NOT EXIST. The client calls `/v1/contracts/:id/cancel`, the server mounts
//      `/v1/contracts/:targetId/:kind/cancel`. The button 404s forever. Two deck entries were wrong
//      this way and were found by a manual verification pass; a rename on the server side would do
//      it again tomorrow, and nothing would notice.
//   2. THE VALUE IS NOT REAL. The client hardcodes a body the server rejects — `{path:'earner'}`
//      when the ids are `gun|brain|face`, or an npchit `tier:'local'` when the ladder is
//      `legbreaker|shooter|...`. The request is well-formed, the route exists, and it fails EVERY
//      time for every player.
//   3. THE FIELD IS NEVER READ. `{price: 50}` when the handler reads `req.body?.unitPrice`. Route
//      exists, value is sane, and the field is simply ignored — the server gets undefined on every
//      call. This is the `{drugId}` vs `{drug}` class, and checks 1 and 2 are both blind to it.
//   4. THE FIELD IS NEVER SENT — the mirror image, and the one the first three are blind to. The
//      client reads `b.book` off a board that returns `active`, or `SEC.windowHours` off a board
//      that never had it. No error is thrown: the screen renders `undefined`, or silently takes a
//      hardcoded fallback, or shows its empty-state coaching on a screen that is not empty. Both
//      of those shipped and are fixed; this now checks every field the client reads.
//
// Both the player console and /admin are covered. The dashboard is the one the founder would be
// holding during an incident, so a dead button there surfaces at the worst possible moment.
//
// Checks 1-3 are STATIC, against the server's own truth — fastify's mounted-route registry and the
// rules catalogs — so there are no side effects, no ordering, and no flake. Firing every control at
// a live server instead cannot tell "the client sent nonsense" apart from "you can't afford it",
// and a check that cannot tell those apart reports noise until someone deletes it.
//
// Check 4 is RUNTIME, by necessity: a response shape is assembled across many lines with spreads
// and conditionals, so reading it out of the source is guesswork, and guesswork here reports
// confident nonsense. It boots the server on pg-mem in-process, builds its own fixture, and looks
// at the actual JSON. No network, no shared state, deterministic.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHECK, so a green run is not read as more than it is: whether a button is
// wired to the RIGHT route (only that its route exists — the four dead ones found on the first run
// were each traced to the correct HANDLER by hand), whether a REQUIRED field is missing rather than
// misnamed, or whether the action then behaves correctly. Those need the gameplay suites, which exist.

//   · a `(?<![\w$.])` lookbehind — without it `m.b.pool` reads as `b.pool`.
//   · JS builtins excluded — `.map`/`.length` are not response fields.
// Anything still unattributable is COUNTED and asserted to be zero, never quietly dropped.

// 2 crew, lvl 4" out of a live <select>, pressed plan it, and was refused; the Empire catalog stated
// "level 15+" over a live [buy] and refused the same way. Requirement stated, control live — which is
// worse than silence, because the player reads the number as information rather than as a wall.
//
// A LEVEL gate is the one kind narrow enough to demand more of, and that narrowness is the whole
// reason this can be a hard check rather than an advisory: it is permanent (not "come back with
// money"), it is one number, and it is compared one way. So: where a clickable row's elements carry
// a level requirement, the row must COMPARE it against the player's level — directly, or through a

// walls on one row are two walls. The one row that genuinely defers to a server-derived boolean is
// waived below by name, which turns a loophole into a decision on the record.

// `w.frontier.canCommand` — and THIRTY LINES BELOW, in the same renderer, shipped three
// boss-or-underboss controls with no rank test at all, each stating "Boss or underboss only" inside

// war ($250,000 — boss only)"; both were driven and both answered 400 rank. Forgotten sibling,
// one screen, thirty lines apart.
//
// The rule: a control whose route can refuse `rank` must be rendered behind a rank test. It is a

// every verb that turns something you already own into money in your pocket.
//
// Played it. Went to ground with a laundromat running, opened The Empire, and the screen read
//   "$120,017 READY TO COLLECT · collect before the pad or a raid eats it"
// over a LIVE button, and the server answered 400 `safe`. The same screen's own warning advises
// "defend yourself (a safehouse, a bodyguard)" — so it urges the state that freezes the take, urges
// the take, and never connects the two. Driven and confirmed across five modules: the front, the
// corner, the club, the port, the fence.
//
// The state was never hidden (the SAFEHOUSE chip counts down on the sheet) and the refusals read
// well — what was missing is that TWELVE take-buttons never asked. And the shape is the familiar
// one: `renderPvp`'s own "go to ground" button ALREADY reads `me.safeSeconds`, and it was the only
// thing in the whole client that did.
//
// The set is DERIVED, not listed: an exported function that (a) gates on `safeHoused(ch)` — the
// ACTOR's own row, never `safeHoused(victim)`, which is a different rule about somebody else — and
// (b) is named collect*/claim*/fence*, i.e. turns what you own into money. That is a principled
// subset with a stated edge: the OFFENSE half of the D2 rule (fire, jump, raid, a round at the club)
// is deliberately out of scope here — those live on screens that carry the safehouse card itself,
// and gating them unplayed would be speculation. A future wave that plays them can widen the name
// filter and the guard will name whatever it finds.

// and EQUIPPING one three lines away said "done." — while BUYING one did not even reach the
// catch-all, because the reply says `price` and the catch-all reads `cost`. So the loudest purchase
// on the screen reported nothing: not the iron, not the money, not the CRATES it also costs (iron
// is the one buy that debits two currencies), and not that the first piece you buy goes on your hip.
//
// The co-op half is the byte-shape collision class at its widest. A crew HEIST, a world RAID and a
// prison BREAK all answer plan/join with an id and a crew count, and describe() is a flat if-chain,
// so whichever branch comes first claims all three. Three separate defects fell out of that:
//   · the break's plan and join said "done." — a plan STAKES a $50,000 cutkit and names the crew
//     the wall needs; both are what a man in a cell wants to know;
//   · leaving and disbanding a break read "the RAID goes on without you" / "you called the RAID
//     off", wrong system both ways, with the staked kit's return unmentioned;
//   · and JOINING a heist rendered the heist PLAN line — "$undefined fronted" for an unnamed job —
//     because the plan branch guarded on `role`, which the join also carries. That one has been
//     live since the plan line shipped, and it is here because the join had never been driven.
//
// The first cut of the break fix keyed on the FIELDS (a crew count and an id) and read
// "you're in on the break" for a world RAID — the collision being fixed, reintroduced while fixing
// it, and caught only by driving the sibling shapes. So all six replies now name their own `op` at
// the SOURCE and every branch keys on that: absence is not a discriminator, it holds only until a
// sibling adds the field you were relying on being missing.
//
// Its own block because the break needs two men in CELLS, and jail refuses nearly everything the
// shared fixture goes on to drive.

// is on the burner" and named none of it: not what was cooking, not how much, not the crates, and

// COLLECT's line, because both answer with a qty and a quality: the byte-shape collision class, with
// the sting that the two mean opposite things about where that quality went. Cutting is a TRADE —
// more units, weaker product — so a line reporting only the new totals is a receipt for a decision
// it never mentions you made.

// and anything not exactly 'engine' falls to armor, so a mistyped track spends the money on the
// other half and reads the same.
//
// Two more that only a drive would find: the Wire's DOSSIER is rendered as a case file on its own
// card and never passes through describe() there — but the raw console posts the same route and
// toasts whatever this makes of it, so the priciest read on the screen answered "done." for a player
// using it. And a world raid's JOIN carried the outfit's ID where its NAME belongs, so the same

// Every mute line so far has been a line that said nothing. This wave's headline says something and
// it is FALSE: buying ammo answered `{ok, ammo: 30}` where 30 is what the BOX ADDED, and the line
// renders it as a total — "30 on you" — so a player holding 55 rounds was told he had 30. Wrong in
// the direction that gets somebody killed, and invisible to every mute sweep, because a line that
// reads well is exactly what a sweep for silence walks past. The delta and the total were ONE field;
// they are two now, and the fixture below buys twice so they DIFFER — with a fixture that starts at
// zero the two are equal and the assertion passes under the mutation it exists to catch.
//
// Both ammo boxes and the workshop bench also spend CRATES, the second currency, and named neither
// it nor the cash. And fixing the bench nearly shipped a collision: adding `cost` to the craft reply
// makes it byte-identical to the Pen commissary's `{ok, item, cost}`, whose branch sits FIRST — so a
// medkit rolled at the bench would have read "the guard slips you a medkit". Absence is not a
// discriminator: the workshop reply had no `cost` only until it needed to state its price. Both key
// on `op` now, and the assertion below holds the pair from BOTH sides.
//
// The family's two command verbs — promote and kick — both answered "done." A boss with five
// soldiers pressed kick and had to go and re-read the roster to learn which one he had just put on
// the street; a promotion named neither the man nor which way he moved, and demotion runs the same
// route, so up and down read identically.

//
// The correct pattern was already in the tree twice over, which is what makes this the forgotten-

// ── WAVE 55 — FIVE VERBS, ONE FIELD, AND THE WRONG POCKET.

// chain over field NAMES, so the three FAMILY collects — territory operations, frontier outposts and
// vassal tribute, every dollar of which lands in the TREASURY — all fell into the personal-business
// line: a boss banking $40,000 of operations income was told he had "collected" it, when he cannot
// spend a dollar of it himself. Frontier and vassals additionally shared one `tributes` line further
// down, so the same figure printed TWICE in one sentence (the wave-36 echo) and a cartel outpost's
// tribute was called "vassal tribute", which is a different system entirely.
//
// The fix is at the SOURCE, on all five: each reply names its own system (`collect: 'business' |
// 'club' | 'territory' | 'frontier' | 'vassals'`) and each branch keys on that. Absence is not a
// discriminator — these five were told apart by which fields they happened to omit, which holds
// exactly until one of them grows a field, and that is how they came to collide.
//
// This block drives all five for real and asserts the PROPERTY rather than the wording: a pocket
// collect must not claim a treasury, a treasury collect must SAY treasury, and no line may print its
// own figure twice. It also carries wave 55's two silences — an estate wing (up to 1,500 $OMR, and
// the line named no price) and the vanity plate (12 $OMR, which read "done." outright).

// the question of every catalog-backed value this ledger drives: where does the rung it picks sit
// in its own catalog? Seven of them drive the FIRST rung, and two of those catalogs turned out to
// be identified by their KEY rather than their name on every line that reports a result.
//
// THE CARTEL OUTFITS. `raidNpc` and the co-op `executeRaid` answered `npc: fixture.id`, and four
// describe() lines plus four feed lines rendered it — so the deepest PvE content in the game read
// "raided the dockrats", "cracked the kryl 3-handed", "the volkov held". All FIVE outfit names
// begin with "The" (The Dock Rats … The Volkov Bratva), so this is wave 57's class arriving from
// underneath: naming them naively would have read "raided the The Dock Rats". The plan line nine
// lines up already knew — its own comment says every outfit's name carries its own article — while
// its three siblings printed a raw key. Two of the four FEED lines (world_routed, frontier_seized)
// already shipped the name, so the same feed named the same outfit two different ways.
//
// THE PORT ROUTES, the same shape with a second edge on top: `launchRun` answered `route: route.id`
// and the line appended a noun — "cast off on the coastal run" — so the apex rung, whose real name
// is "The Deep Run", would have read "the The Deep Run run" the moment it was named. The name says
// it; the noun goes.
//
// Both are fixed at the SOURCE (the reply names the outfit and the route) because the client has no
// catalog of either — the same reason `npcName`/`taskLabel`/`goodName` ship from the server. The
// outfit key is `outfit` and NOT `npcName`: that one is claimed by an early Underworld branch in

// The eleventh catalogue-or-declare ledger, over the class this file has fixed BY HAND fifteen times
// and never swept: describe() is a flat chain over field NAMES, so a reply whose field-set happens to
// satisfy another system's branch gets that system's line. The failures are FLUENT AND FALSE — a
// booked title fight read "they call you true now", buying a loan claim read "took over the club —
// $undefined paid", a rival racket raid read "$undefined out of the war chest" for a bill it never
// charges — so no silence sweep can see them, and every one was found by a person driving that one
// route. The rule: run every act()-reachable reply shape through the REAL describe() and record which
// branch claimed it. A branch claimed by replies from more than one MODULE is either a line the game
// deliberately shares (declared here, with the property that makes it safe) or a collision.
//
// THE CORPUS BOUND IS LOAD-BEARING, and the first cut had none: sweeping every `return {` in src/
// drags in board rows, mod reads and internal helpers — replies that can never reach describe() at
// all — and ~40% of the candidates were that noise, which is the state that makes a guard people
// route around. The bound is decidable: a reply describe() renders is the reply of a route the
// console POSTs or DELETEs, so the corpus is literals returned by a function CALLED inside a
// mutating route registration. 508 of 1218 literals; the 710 dropped are exactly the boards.
//
// Shapes come from the REAL PARSER (a Proxy global + sentinel values), never a hand-rolled key
// scanner — the one written first invented keys that no module sends, because it walked template
// literals naively. Waivers are keyed on the branch's own SOURCE TEXT, never its line number: a
// line-keyed waiver rots on any edit above it, which this repo has paid for once already.

console.log(`✅ client wiring test passed — across the console AND /admin: of ${refs.size} routes they can ` +
  `call, ${refs.size - dynamic.length} resolve to a really-mounted route (segment-wise, so ` +
  `/v1/streets/:id/jump cannot match /v1/streets/roster) and the ${dynamic.length} that build their ` +
  `action at runtime are expanded over every value the client can pick — ${runtimeChecked.length} ` +
  `concrete routes, all mounted, none left unverifiable; all ${checked.length} catalog-backed values they hardcode ` +
  `are ids the server recognises; and every field in ${sends.length} request bodies is one its own ` +
  `route actually reads — including the ones that hand the whole body to a module, followed a file ` +
  `deeper to the parameter it lands in — through a barrel re-export if it takes one. And the mirror: ` +
  `the ${readCount} TOP-LEVEL fields the screens read off ${reads.size} boards are fields those ` +
  `boards really return, observed by fetching each one — plus the ${listCount} fields they read off ` +
  `the ELEMENTS of ${listReads.size} lists, which is where most board rendering lives and which needed ` +
  `a fixture that makes one of everything, because an empty list must never read as a pass. ` +
  `And the fifth way, which is not death but a lie: of those lists, ${[...listActs].length} hang a ` +
  `CLICK on each row, and where the server sends that row a gate the renderer has to read it — a ` +
  `control that looks live and only refuses once pressed is the game withholding its own rule. ` +
  `And the SIXTH, which is not a lie but a silence: where a board states an ONGOING cost — the pad, the nut, the cold clock — the screen rendering it has to read that too, because a card that takes your money without mentioning what it keeps costing is how both of those reached a tester. Those are the ways a button lies — this has found four dead routes, seven ` +
  `ignored fields, two element fields the board never sent (a LEGENDARY chip that had never ` +
  `once rendered) and a lane picker that offered every route to a level-6 player and refused on ` +
  `press, among them a broken action, an ammo box sold by a control that asked for a ` +
  `quantity it could not honour, and an unstake box that emptied the whole stake whatever you typed. ` +
  `And the SEVENTH, which is not a bug but the door one walks through: the tight allowlists 5 and 6 ` +
  `enforce cannot see a gate or a cost shipped under a name they do not yet know, so a completeness ` +
  `sweep flags every field across all ${reads.size} boards whose NAME reads like a gate or an ongoing ` +
  `cost — each must be enforced above or waived here with a reason (${REVIEWED_NOT_ENFORCED.size} are), ` +
  `so a new one is a decision on the record, not a silent regression. ` +
  `And the EIGHTH, which is not a lie but a shrug: a button that works and then says nothing. ` +
  `act() toasts describe() with no override, so ${describedCount} driven actions must each read back ` +
  `as something a player can act on — a play session found 65 that said nothing usable, among them ` +
  `an unstake that had just opened a six-hour window in which that $OMR can be looted off you, and a ` +
  `bank deposit that rides in transit and is lootable until it clears — both TERMS, not flavour — and an ` +
  `errand that signs a player up for a THREE-DAY job while carrying the very task it would not name. ` +
  `${Object.keys(CATALOGS).length} fields have ` +
  `catalogs and every other literal field is either an i18n key or declared not-an-API-value, so a ` +
  `new one forces that decision instead of being skipped in silence. And the NINTH, which check 5 is ` +
  `satisfied by and cannot see: reading a wall is not enforcing it. ${lvlChecked} clickable rows state a ` +
  `LEVEL requirement, and each must compare it to the player's level — directly, through a helper its ` +
  `renderer defines, or by deferring to a boolean the server derived from it. Printing the number in the ` +
  `label satisfies "the renderer reads the gate" while leaving the control live, which is worse than ` +
  `silence because the player reads a wall as trivia: a play session found four that way — the heist ` +
  `picker, the open crew board, the world crew raid and the Empire catalog all stated a level over a ` +
  `live button and refused on press. And the TENTH, the same class on the family's other axis: ` +
  `${rankStats.routes} routes can refuse rank, and the ${rankStats.markup} data-do controls and `+
  `${rankStats.wired} wired controls reaching one are each drawn behind a rank test — checked at the `+
  `CONDITION that drew them, walking out through the enclosing interpolations, because a byte window `+
  `reads the neighbouring button's gate as this one's. A soldier was offered "sue for peace" and `+
  `"declare a family war (boss only)" thirty lines below the frontier controls that read the `+
  `server's own canCommand, and both answered 400 rank. And the ELEVENTH, the same class on a wall `+
  `a player raises themselves: a safehouse is a shield, not a bunker, so ${shieldStats.routes} routes `+
  `that turn what you own into money refuse while you are to ground — and the ${shieldStats.markup} `+
  `data-do plus ${shieldStats.wired} wired take-controls reaching one now each read that state, the `+
  `figure still on screen because it is the reason to surface. The Empire read "$120,017 READY TO `+
  `COLLECT - collect before the pad or a raid eats it" over a live button while the server answered `+
  `safe, on a screen whose own warning advises going to ground. And the TWELFTH, which is the `
  + `EIGHTH swept instead of driven: check 8 proves the ${describedCount} actions it DRIVES read as `
  + `something, and nineteen play waves found the rest one cluster at a time. This runs every `
  + `act()-reachable reply in src/ through the real describe() and flags the ones that render the `
  + `catch-all — 7 of them sit on routes the console presses, and each is declared with the `
  + `property that makes the silence right. It found thirteen live: the WINDOW, the one rail `
  + `turning $OMR back into cash, said "done." over the burn, the rate and the family's cut; `
  + `squaring your name read "paid $50,000" for a purchase that lifts the WANTED mark and the `
  + `welsher brand together; fencing a score framed money RECEIVED as money spent; and the `
  + `sovereignty pad's nothing-owed early return had dropped the one field its own branch reads, `
  + `so the line written for exactly that case was unreachable.`);
