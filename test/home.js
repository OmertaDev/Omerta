// THE HOME AGGREGATE (/v1/home) — one read for the landing screen's fifteen read-only boards.
//
// The centre of this file is a CONTRACT, not a shape: every key the aggregate returns must be byte
// for byte what that board's OWN route serves. It matters because the two halves are checked by
// different things — the client mirror verifies the screen's reads against `/v1/home|<key>`, while
// agents and `/v1/screens` still use `/v1/<key>` — so a drift between them would leave one of those
// two audiences reading a board nothing has ever checked.
//
// The other two claims are the ones a consolidation can silently give up:
//   · ISOLATION — today a board that throws 500s its own request and the other fifteen cards still
//     render. Consolidating without isolation makes one broken board blank the landing screen.
//   · READ-ONLY — `readCharacter` prefers a no-BEGIN path whose client REFUSES writes, so a writing
//     board cannot ride in the aggregate at all. That is why `/v1/bulletin` is deliberately NOT in
//     it (it materialises the week's snapshot), and the read path succeeding is what proves the
//     property for every board that IS — a claim about all fifteen, not a comment about one.
