// THE CITY LEG'S ACTIVITY METRIC (THE BANK, omerta-bank-protocol-design.md §4.2).
// Protocol profit buys $OMR on the open market and gives it to "the players who play". This file
// pins what that phrase means, and every assertion here is a property the distribution's safety
// rests on rather than a happy path:
//
//   (1) LINEARITY — splitting one player's effort across N accounts must yield the IDENTICAL total.
//       A concave score (a per-account cap, log-share) makes splitting profitable, which is the
//       measured Street Wage bug (BALANCE § THE FARM: "concentration is the OPPOSITE of Sybil").
//   (2) THE SEVERANCE WALL — tokenomics v2 severed cash from $OMR. The Madame's T1 perk comps the
//       nerve on dice AND blackjack (src/casino.js:116/:844) and sellGood has no throttle, so an
//       unthrottled tag in TAGS would let cash buy a share of the bought-$OMR pool.
//   (3) THE GATE IS NOT A CAP — MIN_TRACKS charges a fixed cost per ACCOUNT (Sybil-negative) and
//       never clips an honest player's payout (which would be Sybil-positive).
//
// Pure arithmetic over the live constants. No server, no database.
