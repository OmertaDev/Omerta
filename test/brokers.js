// THE BROKERS — the activation sink and the epoch allocator.
// Design: `omerta-brokers-design.md`.
//
// What this file is really asserting is THE WEIGHT, because the weight is the whole design and the
// two ways it can be zero are what make this a game mechanic rather than a yield product:
//
//     weight = activationTier x activityScore
//
// Stonkbrokers' weight is a pure function of tokens burned, so their largest holder is by
// construction their largest earner. Ours multiplies by measured play, so an activated NFT owned by
// somebody who did not play earns NOTHING. That assertion is the point of this file.
