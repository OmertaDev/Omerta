// TOKENOMICS v2 — THE EXCHANGE and THE FAMILY YIELD (the 57th suite).
// Design: omerta-tokenomics-v2-design.md
//
// What this has to prove, in order of how much it would cost to get wrong:
//   1. The window's cash side is a BOUNDED REDISTRIBUTION, not inflation. It pays only what real
//      sinks funded, and `exchange pool backed` (paid <= funded) proves it after the fact.
//   2. A dry pool burns NOTHING. The window is a claim on what was funded, never a promise — and
//      burning into an empty till would take the token and give nothing back.
//   3. §10.4 still reconciles exactly with a burn on one side and a faucet on the other.
//   4. The family yield is a TRANSFER, so the $OMR bucket sum is unmoved by a distribution.

// ── STEP 3: THE FLOAT, RE-SOURCED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The design's §6 gap, in one sentence: the DEX tax scales with TRADING VOLUME, and a one-way
// conversion is designed to produce a quiet market — so a tax-only float grows fastest exactly when
// it is needed least. Bond ETH is primary inflow and does not care whether anyone is trading.
//
// What must not go wrong, in order of cost:
//   1. A comp/QA episode must fund NOTHING. Fabricated backing is how "the game only ever owes stock
//      it already owns" becomes a lie the anti-Ponzi check cannot see, because the check compares
//      allocation to HELD units and fake revenue buys real-looking units.
//   2. The slices must reconcile to the gross. A split that loses or invents ETH means the float is
//      funded by something other than what the tax actually took.
//   3. The whole thing writes ZERO §10.4 rows — it is out-of-band real value, like the Vig and bonds.
