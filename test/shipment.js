// THE SHIPMENT (omerta-scarcity-design.md §3) — the contested daily material.
//
// What this proves:
//   1. CONTENTION IS REAL — the city-wide cap is a shared quantity: what one player takes, another
//      cannot. Two players race it and the second is told the truth. That is the whole feature.
//   2. LOCATION + PER-PLAYER CAPS — it lands where the seed says (forecastable, unmanufacturable),
//      and one whale cannot take the lot.
//   3. NOT A CURRENCY — taking it writes ZERO ledger rows. It is an owned quantity: LOOTABLE on a
//      fire-kill, and it dies with the street.
//   4. AN INPUT, NEVER AN OUTPUT — the material pays nothing; its only use is a COMMISSION, which is
//      a cash SINK. So the drop is emission-safe by construction, asserted as a ledger identity.
// pg-mem, zero infra.
