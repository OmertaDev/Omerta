// THE DOCUMENTATION THAT CAN BE WRONG (the 52nd suite).
//
// Prose does not have a test suite, so it rots silently — and unlike code, wrong prose does not fail
// loudly the first time someone relies on it. It makes the next maintainer confidently do the wrong
// thing. One session found FIVE instances:
//
//   * a comment on `levelOf` instructing the reader to RE-APPLY the pacing divisor by hand after any
//     regeneration — a hazard that did not exist, because the extractor already preserved that line;
//   * SPEC's "lines 1–1,091 are auto-generated" — the real figure was 454, so it described the
//     hand-written half as 70% of the file when it was closer to 90%;
//   * SPEC's backend module count, which counted a FLAT listing of src/ and so under-reported by 27
//     files the moment code moved into subdirectories;
//   * CLAUDE.md describing itself as "~1,000 lines of dense prose" while being over five thousand;
//   * a comment I wrote claiming reads no longer checkpoint accrual, which measurement disproved.
//
// So the load-bearing FACTS are asserted here against the tree. Not the prose — prose is judgement and
// belongs to whoever writes it — but every number a reader might act on, and every claim of the form
// "X must be done by hand" that a test can settle. A figure in SPEC.md is now either true or CI fails.
//
// Adding a number to SPEC's size table without adding it here is fine; the table is checked row by row
// for the rows that exist, so an unchecked row simply is not guarded. Prefer to guard it.

// (gitignored, fetched for tools/compile-contracts.js) carrying one README.md, so the tree held 127
// markdown files and a fresh clone held 126. It passed locally every single time and failed on every
// push. That is precisely the failure this file exists to catch — a claim that is true in one
// environment and false in another — and I did not notice because I never opened CI.
//
// `git ls-files` is the fix and the lesson: any guard that asserts a number about "the project" has
// to ask git what the project is. Falls back to the walk when git is unavailable (a tarball, a
// vendored copy), which is the only case where the disk is the best answer available.
//
// `--cached --others --exclude-standard`, and that is the SAME lesson in a second costume. Plain
// `git ls-files` lists only TRACKED files, so a brand-new doc does not count until it is `git add`ed
// — which means running this guard before committing and running it after committing give DIFFERENT
// answers, and the pre-commit one is the one a person actually runs. It bit on 2026-07-31: a new
// audit report passed locally at 142 and failed CI at 143, in a file whose whole purpose is catching
// claims that are true in one environment and false in another. The flags add untracked-but-not-
// ignored files, so the count is what the NEXT COMMIT will contain rather than what the last one did.
//
// The DEDUPE is that lesson in a THIRD costume, and it cost a wrong figure on 2026-08-21. During an
// unresolved merge `--cached` lists a CONFLICTED path once per stage (base/ours/theirs), so running
// this guard mid-merge counted four conflicted .md files three times each and reported 218 where the
// repository holds 210 — and the number looked authoritative enough that SPEC was restated to it.
// A set is the fix: a file is one file in every state of the index, merge in progress or not.

// right net for the failure that occurs, because a whole-tree re-denomination leaves the stale

// says it plainly: nothing here may be called deflationary. Verified against the code rather than
// taken on trust — `recyclesToDesk` returns true for all 27 sink reasons and false for exactly one,
// `withdraw:omr`, and even THAT is not a supply reduction (the token leaves the in-game ledger to
// exist on-chain in the player's own wallet, backed one-for-one; it changes venue, nothing is
// destroyed). So there is no mechanic left that could justify a scarcity claim about $OMR.

// project: the landing page said "$OMR is not created in game at all" while `omrMints` enumerates
// four live reasons — the mission ladder pays for play, and three more mint against a real token
// arriving. A player could check that in one query.
//
// THE GUARD IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, and that is the lesson from the price-parity check above: a

// NO LAUNCH-GATING DOC MAY CALL A CONTRACT UNWRITTEN WHILE ITS FILE EXISTS (2026-08-21).
//
// `CHAIN-DEPLOY.md` said, in the paragraph stating what is live TODAY, that `StockVault` was
// unwritten and "there is no claim route to find". It had shipped 2026-08-14 with a delivery
// keeper, a prover and a `delivered ≤ allocated` wall — and the SAME document listed it in the
// audit batch forty lines above, so the document contradicted itself and the stale half made the
// operative claim. It errs in the direction that UNDERSTATES what is live, which is the worst
// direction for a security review: an auditor told a contract does not exist does not attack it.
//
// Scope is deliberately CHAIN-DEPLOY + DEPLOY, the two documents whose only value is being
// accurate about the tree RIGHT NOW. CLAUDE.md is excluded on purpose: it is a chronological log
// where "not built" is a true statement about the day it was written and later entries supersede.

// naming its own fix, and a guard that fires on the correction is one people route around.
