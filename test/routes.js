// THE MOUNTED SURFACE (the 48th suite).
//
// server.js registers ~279 routes in one 2,400-line file, and the thing that would actually hurt is
// not a route going missing — a missing route fails loudly the first time anything calls it. It is a
// route quietly losing its `auth` preHandler and becoming PUBLIC. Nothing else in the suite would
// notice: every other test authenticates, so an endpoint that stopped requiring a token still passes.
//
// So the invariant is stated the only way that catches it: every /v1 route is authenticated unless it
// is EXPLICITLY listed here as public. Adding a public route is then a deliberate act with a diff,
// which is the decision you want forced. This also guards the server.js split — a route that lands in
// the wrong module, or loses its preHandler on the way, shows up here rather than in production.
//
// The registry is fastify's own onRoute output (app.routes), so it reflects what is really mounted,
// not what a comment claims.

//
// The fix is hand-rolled (server.js: one onSend hook + a precompressed servePage), on the sol.js
// precedent, which means every condition in it is ours to keep true. These are those conditions,
// stated as properties rather than as an implementation:
//
//   • text compresses when the client asks, and MATERIALLY (a hook that ran and saved nothing would
//     read exactly like a hook that works)
//   • identity is honoured, byte-for-byte against the file on disk — a client that cannot decode
//     gzip must get the real thing, not a corrupted one
//   • the gzip DECODES to the same bytes. A corrupt stream is the worst failure here: the page is
//     blank and nothing 500s.
//   • Vary: Accept-Encoding on BOTH branches, or a shared cache hands the compressed copy to a
//     client that said it could not read it
//   • the ETag answers 304, which is what makes a repeat visit free rather than merely smaller
//   • BINARY IS NEVER TOUCHED. Gzipping a PNG spends CPU to make it slightly bigger, and the same
//     exclusion is what keeps a byte-range response honest.
//   • a small payload is left alone — under the threshold the framing can grow it.
