# OMERTÀ — off-chain alpha go-live checklist

The fresh-deploy runbook for the off-chain game (chain layer stays dormant unless the `CHAIN_*` vars below
are set). Two Node processes over one Postgres DB. No build step.

## 0. Pre-flight (on the release commit)
- [ ] `npm ci` (or `npm install`) — one runtime dep tree; no native build required for the game (the
      `@resvg/resvg-js` used by social-share PNGs is an **optionalDependency** — absent → cards fall back to SVG).
- [ ] `npm test` → **113 suites green**.
- [ ] `node tools/sim.js` → ends with `✅ sim complete — §10.4 holds exactly` (drift-0).
- [ ] **`npm run preflight`** — on the box, with the real environment loaded. Runs exactly the checks
      the server runs at startup, so a green result means it will boot; non-zero exit means it won't,
      with the reasons listed. Run it BEFORE cutting traffic over rather than reading a stack trace at
      3am. (`src/preflight.js` is the single source of truth for every env var this server reads;
      `test/preflight.js` fails the suite if any new one is left unclassified, which is how the
      pacing-pass knobs came to be unguarded in the first place.)
- [ ] **`npm run pgcheck`** against a throwaway Postgres — the suite runs on pg-mem, which is by
      construction blind to node-pg's own contract, and a real deploy runs node-pg. This drives the
      core loop on real Postgres and FAILS on any pg deprecation. It has already caught one: 16
      overlapping queries on a single pooled client in `loadOwned`, deprecated today and removed in
      pg@9 — i.e. an upgrade would have 500'd every action in the game.
      ```
      createdb omerta_check
      DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/omerta_check JWT_SECRET=x MOD_KEY=y \
        MARKET_SEED='<32 random chars>' SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE=off npm run pgcheck
      ```
- [ ] **`npm run loadtest`** against the same throwaway Postgres — many players at once, which no other
      check exercises. Every §10.4 proof elsewhere is SEQUENTIAL, and lost updates live in the overlap
      between requests; this one asserts the ledger is unmoved by thousands of concurrent operations and
      reads `pg_stat_database.deadlocks` directly, because the codebase retries `40P01` as `contention`
      so a lock-order bug is otherwise invisible. Exits non-zero on drift, a 5xx, or pool exhaustion.
      ```
      DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/omerta_check JWT_SECRET=x MOD_KEY=yyyyyyyyyyyy \
        MARKET_SEED='<32 random chars>' SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE=off LOAD_PLAYERS=30 npm run loadtest
      ```
      First measurement (2026-07-26): flat ~175 req/s from 5 to 50 players with latency rising linearly
      — a CPU-bound queue, not a lock wall — **zero deadlocks at every level**, and §10.4 unmoved. Run it
      after anything that touches a lock, a transaction boundary, or the pool. Absolute req/s is a
      property of the machine and is not a capacity figure — and it cannot be one, because this harness
      boots the server IN-PROCESS with its client loops, so its req/s is server AND clients together.
      **For the capacity question — how many players can we take, and which plan moves it — see the
      measurement in `render.yaml` beside `PG_POOL_MAX`** (server and Postgres isolated in cgroups at the
      real plan sizes: the DATABASE plan is the dial, ~+50% against the web plan's ~+2%).
- [ ] **`npm run chaos`** against a throwaway Postgres you are allowed to STOP AND START — the only check
      that interrupts anything. It SIGKILLs the worker mid-sweep and verifies the resumed run pays exactly
      once (twenty sweeps in this codebase claim to be idempotent; this is what makes that claim true),
      terminates ~80 backends mid-transaction under load, and stops Postgres entirely underneath a running
      server. Exits non-zero on drift, a double payout, or the process dying.
      ```
      # On a Debian/Ubuntu package install pg_ctl must run AS the postgres user and be pointed at the
      # config, which the packaged layout keeps apart from the data directory. PG_CTL takes any
      # command, so a wrapper does it. (A bare `pg_ctl -D …` as root fails to start — and the harness
      # then reports the outage as unrecoverable, which reads exactly like a real bug.)
      printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/sh' \
        'exec su postgres -c "/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/16/main \
           -o '"'"'-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf'"'"' $*"' > /tmp/pgctl.sh
      chmod +x /tmp/pgctl.sh

      DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/omerta_check JWT_SECRET=x MOD_KEY=yyyyyyyyyyyy \
        MARKET_SEED='<32 random chars>' SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE=off \
        PG_CTL=/tmp/pgctl.sh npm run chaos
      ```
      `PG_CTL` is optional — without it the full-outage scenario is SKIPPED and says so, rather than
      silently passing. On its first run it found the other half of the 2026-07-25 outage bug (see §7b):
      a connection dying mid-transaction still killed the whole API. The full-outage scenario itself
      first RAN on 2026-07-26 and passed — the API survived Postgres being stopped underneath it,
      answered `503 db_down` (never a 500) throughout, and recovered with no redeploy. That path had
      been reasoned about since the outage; it is now measured.
      **CI already runs everything except the full-outage scenario** (it needs `pg_ctl` on the database
      host, which a service container has no way to provide). So the reason to run this by hand is
      exactly that scenario — do it before any deploy that touches the pool, a transaction boundary, or
      a worker sweep.
- [ ] (chain path only — not needed for off-chain alpha) `cd omerta-contracts && forge test` on a real
      Foundry toolchain. **Still the pre-mainnet gate; egress-blocked in CI here.**

## 1. Required environment (production boot REFUSES without these)
| Var | Why | Boot guard |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV=production` | enables rate limits + the boot guards below | — |
| `DATABASE_URL` | real Postgres; refuses pg-mem in prod (RAM-only = data loss on restart) | db.js |
| `JWT_SECRET` | signs player tokens; refuses the dev fallback | server.js |
| `MARKET_SEED` | secret ≥24 chars / ≥8 distinct; the §7.11 draw seed (Numbers/Track/Fight/goods). A weak seed is offline-recoverable from the public prices board → predictable money draws | preflight.js |
| `MOD_KEY` | the only credential on the mod perimeter (ban / mod-kill / confiscate / comp grants) and on `/admin`. Fails closed — unset means every mod route 401s | preflight.js |

**Also refused:** any of the **44 test-only** roll/timer knobs (`SEARCH_MS`, `LAW_BUST_P`, `TRAIN_CD_MS`,
`MISSION_CD_MS`, `PEN_BREAK_P`, `ALLOW_MOD_REAL_REVENUE`, …). Each one pins a money roll to always-win or
collapses a pacing timer server-wide; `TRAIN_CD_MS`/`MISSION_CD_MS` in particular would reinstate the
"level 240 in two hours" speedrun the pacing pass fixed. The full list is `TEST_ONLY_ENV` in
`src/preflight.js` — and `test/preflight.js` fails if a knob is ever added without being classified.

## 1b. Must be STATED (production refuses to boot without an explicit value)
- [ ] `SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE` = `live` | `trust` | `off`. It defaults to `off`, which pays the
      Spread-the-Word faucet **nothing** while still accepting posts — that default silently ran on a
      live server once. `live` is what an alpha wants (real X verification, needs the X keys in §3);
      `off` is a legitimate choice, but it now has to be a *choice*.
- [ ] **`live` ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH — it needs a token to verify WITH.** `SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE=live` with
      no `X_BEARER_TOKEN` was the state the Render blueprint shipped: every social claim threw, so the
      Spread-the-Word faucet paid nobody and two First-Week tasks were listed-but-unclaimable, which
      made the all-done capstone unreachable. Nothing announced it. Now the server degrades honestly —
      a task whose provider is unconfigured is **dropped from the checklist**, and Spread-the-Word
      reports itself off — and preflight WARNS naming the missing variable. It is a warning, not an
      error, on purpose: preflight errors are fatal, and taking a running server down to fix a dormant
      faucet is worse than the dormant faucet. **`/admin` → "Growth loop" says PAYING or NOT PAYING**,
      which is the check that actually gets read. Per provider: `X_BEARER_TOKEN` enables post checks
      (the one that matters), `+ X_TARGET_USER_ID` the follow task — and that one only pays off for
      players who signed in WITH X, since the follow check reads their X identity.

## 2. Recommended production config
- [ ] `MOD_KEY=<secret>` — gates the mod tools + the `/admin` ops dashboard (timing-safe compared). Without
      it the mod surface is disabled.
- [ ] `RATE_LIMIT=on` — token buckets (auto-on in prod anyway; set explicitly to be sure).
- [ ] `TRUST_PROXY=on` — **only if** behind a load balancer / reverse proxy, so per-IP throttles key on the
      real client IP (`X-Forwarded-For`), not the proxy. Leave OFF if the app is internet-facing directly.
- [ ] `PG_POOL_MAX` — `render.yaml` declares **40** (api) / 20 (worker); the code default is 20, and
      at ~30 concurrent players the 20-pool COLLAPSES (queueing on `connectionTimeout` → 503s read as an
      outage — measured 2026-08-11: 30 vs 284 req/s). Keep it declared; scale the DATABASE plan first.
- [ ] `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL=<url>` — §10.4 drift, Vig/Bond, and backup-watchdog alerts (recommended).
      **Must be set on the WORKER process** — every automatic alarm lives there (`src/worker.js`); the api
      only alerts on a manual `GET /v1/mod/invariants` or an `/admin` load. On Render, put it on the shared
      env group so both get it. A Slack or Discord webhook URL works as-is: the payload carries `text` and
      `content` alongside the structured fields, because those services 400 a body with neither and
      `alertDrift` swallows the error — a webhook that looked configured would have delivered nothing.
      **Getting one (Discord, 60 seconds):** Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook →
      pick a channel → *Copy Webhook URL*. It looks like `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>`.
      **Slack:** api.slack.com/apps → your app → Incoming Webhooks → *Add New Webhook to Workspace*.
      **Then PROVE it:** open `/admin` → Mod Tools → **send test alert**. A message must land in the
      channel within seconds. `/admin`'s Backups panel also carries an *alerts reach you* line, so an
      unset webhook is visible rather than discovered the night the ledger drifts. Treat the URL as a
      password — anyone who has it can post into that channel.
- [ ] `CITY_WIRE_WEBHOOK_URL=<url>` — **THE CITY WIRE** (optional, organic marketing): a SEPARATE Discord
      channel webhook that posts a curated, public-safe subset of the streets feed (kills, wars declared/won,
      empire sackings, monument completions, prison breaks, title fights) so the city's own drama becomes
      reach. **Set it on the API process** (the streets bus lives there, not the worker — the mirror of the
      alert webhook). Dormant unless set; posts names + the event only, NEVER a dollar figure; throttled to
      20 posts / 10 min. Make it a PUBLIC community channel (this is marketing, not ops) — keep it distinct
      from `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL`, which is a private ops alarm.

## 3. The X integrations — the full checklist (one-click sign-in + social verification)
All from https://developer.x.com (create a Project + App once). Every X surface degrades cleanly
when unconfigured — sign-in buttons hide, social claims fail-closed — so set these when ready:

**One-click X sign-in (OAuth2 PKCE, server-side exchange):**
- [ ] `X_CLIENT_ID` — the app's OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
- [ ] `X_CLIENT_SECRET` — set it if the app is a *confidential* client (recommended); omit for public PKCE.
- [ ] `PUBLIC_URL=https://www.omerta.fun` — and register the callback on the X app as **exactly**
      `https://www.omerta.fun/v1/auth/x/callback` (App settings → User authentication → Callback URI).
      Scopes needed: `users.read tweet.read`. Type of app: Web App. A mismatched callback = every
      sign-in fails at X's door.

**Social verification (First-Week follow + Spread-the-Word post checks, `SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE=live`):**
- [ ] `X_BEARER_TOKEN` — the app's Bearer Token (app-only auth; reads tweets + follow lists).
- [ ] `X_TARGET_USER_ID` — the game's X account **numeric id** (not the handle — get it from
      `GET /2/users/by/username/<handle>` or an online lookup) for the follow check.
- [ ] `SOCIAL_X_HANDLE` — the handle (no @) used in share/brag intent links.
- Note: the follow check paginates to 5000 follows; X rate limits are per-app and tight — transient
  429s surface to players as a clean retryable "X is busy" (`verify_busy`), never as a failed task,
  and every X call is time-boxed at 8–10s so an X outage can never hang the game.

**Leave unset:** `X_TRUST_USER_TOKEN` — the legacy paste-token sign-in (default off; the PKCE flow
above is the real path and the only one the console offers).

## 3b. Other optional
- `INVITE_MODE=on` — closed-alpha gate; mint codes via `POST /v1/mod/invites`.
- `PRIVY_APP_ID` — enables Privy sign-in (else guest + X only).
- `SOCIAL_GAME_URL` — falls back for `PUBLIC_URL` in share links, OG cards, the OpenAPI `baseUrl`.
- `REDIS_URL` — moves the rate-limit buckets off in-memory (needed only for multi-instance).
- **Web push (`VAPID_*`)** — optional but the **single highest-ROI retention switch** for a lazy-accrual
  game (the worker pushes URGENT undelivered notifications to away players — a contract on their head, an
  indictment, an empire seized). Dormant unless set; the client hides the 🔔 when absent. Generate a key
  pair ONCE with **`npm run vapid`** and set `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` + `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (+ optional
  `VAPID_SUBJECT`, default `mailto:ops@omerta.fun`) on the **API** (which serves the public key on
  `/v1/rules`) **and the worker** (which does the sending). Keep the PRIVATE key secret. Zero §10.4 surface.
  Once set, the client stops hiding the 🔔 and adds a CONTEXTUAL opt-in — the first time the city moves on
  a player (a contract on their head, a body, an indictment, or the aha-moment call-out), it asks once
  whether to turn alerts on (the OS permission prompt only fires inside that user tap). The worker sweep
  SKIPS anyone active in the last `PUSH_SKIP_ACTIVE_MIN` minutes (default **3** — a live tab already saw
  it on the websocket) and DIGESTS a batch into one buzz, so a returning player gets "3 things need you",
  not three separate buzzes. That's the whole activation: generate the pair, set it on both services,
  redeploy — no code change, and `/admin → Integrations` reads back live-vs-off.

- **Email digest (`EMAIL_API_KEY`)** — the opt-in "while you were gone" re-engagement email for lapsed
  players (the worker builds it from the Morning Paper and sends it). Dormant unless set; the client hides
  the opt-in card when absent, and NOTHING sends until a player opts in on My Profile. Set `EMAIL_API_KEY`
  (a Resend API key by default; `EMAIL_API_URL` overrides the endpoint for another provider) + `EMAIL_FROM`
  (e.g. `OMERTA <noreply@yourdomain>`) on the **worker** (it does the sending), redeploy, and players can
  opt in. Windows tune with `DIGEST_LAPSE_DAYS` (3) / `DIGEST_COOLDOWN_DAYS` (7) / `DIGEST_MAX_LAPSE_DAYS`
  (30). Every email carries a one-click unsubscribe; keep the copy founder-cleared. Zero §10.4 surface.

### The switchboard — `/admin` → **Integrations**
The retention/funnel wiring all ships DORMANT and switches on by env config (no code deploy). The
`/admin` dashboard's **Integrations** panel reads which are live vs off and prints the exact activation
steps for each — it reads env PRESENCE only, so no key or webhook URL ever leaves the server. Priority
order for a fresh alpha: **(1)** Web push (`VAPID_*`) — retention; **(2)** X one-click sign-in
(`X_CLIENT_ID` + `PUBLIC_URL`) — removes top-of-funnel friction; **(3)** the Discord city wire
(`CITY_WIRE_WEBHOOK_URL`) — free organic reach. These three are the cheapest, highest-leverage wins
available and are already built and tested — the panel just tells you which are on.

## 4. Chain — LEAVE UNSET for the off-chain alpha
The chain service is dormant unless configured. Setting `CHAIN_RPC_URL` + `CHAIN_ID` +
`VOUCHER_CLAIM_ADDRESS` (+ `VOUCHER_SIGNER_PK`, `OMERTA_FEES_ADDRESS`, …) activates the watcher/withdraw
rail — **do not** until the chain go-live path (devnet → audit → mainnet, gated on the launch checklist + the third-party
contract+signer audit). `ALLOW_MOD_REAL_REVENUE` is a QA-only flag — **never** set in production.

## 5. NEVER set in production (the boot guard rejects them)
All test-only roll/timer overrides — `SEARCH_MS`, `SHOOT_CD_MS`, `RACE_CD_MS`, `*_MS` window knobs, and the
roll switches `LAW_BUST_P`, `SHANK_P`, `PEN_BREAK_P`, `WORLD_RAID_P`, `BUSINESS_RAID_P`, `PORT_INTERDICT_P`,
`PORT_SINK`, `PORT_PIRATE_WIN`, `SPEAKEASY_RAID_P`, `SPEAKEASY_STANDOVER_P`, `TERRITORY_*_P`, `WANTED_HUNT_P`,
`WORLD_UPRISING*`, `PEN_YARD_EVENT`, … They turn money rolls into always-win switches; **server.js refuses to
boot in production if any is set** — no action needed beyond not setting them.

## 6. Processes (both against the same `DATABASE_URL`)
- **API** — `npm start` (`node src/server.js`), listens on `PORT` (default 8080), host `0.0.0.0`. Serves the
  console (`/`), `/admin`, `/wiki`, `/agents`, `/openapi.json`, and the `/v1` API + `/v1/ws`.
- **Worker** — `npm run worker` (`node src/worker.js`), ONE instance: the 12h buyback, nightly §10.4 monitor,
  season rollover, and every lazy sweep (auctions/tournaments/loans/law/wanted/world/pen/wire/…). The game
  still functions without it, but income/settlements/alerts stall — run it.

## 7. First-boot behaviour (automatic)
On the real-Postgres branch, boot applies `schema.sql` (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) then runs the
**idempotent column migration** (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, derived from schema.sql) — so a **fresh** DB is
created whole and an **in-place upgrade** of an existing DB back-fills any later-added columns (logged as
`[db] Postgres ready — column migration ran N …`). No manual migration step. (MED-1/R30 — the in-place
break is closed; a proper FK/migration-tool pass remains an optional defense-in-depth follow-up.)

## 7b. When the database goes down — what you should see (and what to do)
The 2026-07-25 incident was hard to read because a database problem and a code bug produced the
identical response (`500 {"error":"internal"}`), so "Internal on every button" could have been either.
That is now separated:

| you see | it means | do |
|---|---|---|
| `503 {"error":"db_down"}` on game routes | the database is unreachable; **nothing was lost**, it recovers by itself | check the DB dashboard; no code change needed |
| `500 {"error":"internal"}` | a real bug | read the server log; it is not an outage |
| `GET /health` → `503 {"ok":false,"db":"unreachable"}` | same, from a keyless probe | as above |

- **The API survives a database restart.** It logs `[db] idle client error …`, keeps serving 503s, and
  reconnects on its own when Postgres returns — no redeploy, no manual restart. (Before this was fixed
  the process *died* on every DB bounce, which is the likeliest real cause of the "Internal on every
  crime" report.) Verified by stopping a real Postgres under a running server.
- **…and it survives a connection dying MID-TRANSACTION**, which is a different code path and was still
  fatal after the fix above. `pool.on('error')` covers connections sitting idle in the pool; a connection
  a request is actively using raises the error on itself, and with no listener that killed the process
  just the same. You will now see `[db] in-flight client error (this request fails; the process
  survives)` — that request 503s, everything else carries on. It fires on a failover landing mid-request,
  on an admin `pg_terminate_backend`, and on our own 30s idle-transaction timeout. Found by
  `npm run chaos`, which kills ~80 backends mid-transaction under load specifically to provoke it.
- **The worker** skips a tick with one line (`worker: database unreachable … skipping this tick`)
  instead of dumping ~60 stack traces, and logs `database back after N skipped tick(s)` on recovery.
  Every sweep is idempotent, so nothing is lost by skipping.
- **Point an uptime monitor at `GET /health`** (keyless, no secret in the URL). It reports
  `{ok, db, dbLatencyMs, uptimeSeconds}` and returns 503 when the DB is unreachable, so a monitor can
  alert on status code alone.
- **Think twice before making `/health` the PLATFORM's own health check.** Restarting the API does not
  fix a database — it just adds a restart loop on top of an outage. Alerting on it is the point;
  auto-restarting on it usually is not.

## 7d. "Something looks wrong" — the one path to follow

Rehearsed end to end on 2026-07-27 against a real Postgres that was then stopped, in a real browser.
Three defects were found doing it and are fixed; what follows is the path as it now behaves.

**1. Is it up?  →  `https://your-domain/health`**
Keyless, answers in one line. `200 {"ok":true,"db":"up"}` means the game is serving players.
`503 {"db":"unreachable"}` means the API is alive but the database is not — see step 3.
Nothing at all means the API process itself is down; your host's dashboard is the place to look.

**2. What is wrong?  →  `https://your-domain/admin`, enter your `MOD_KEY`**
The dashboard leads with three banners, in the order you care about them:
  · **THE DATABASE IS UNREACHABLE** — the game is down for players. Everything below is stale.
  · **BACKUPS ARE FAILING** — the game is fine; your ability to RESTORE it is not. Do not ignore this.
  · **§10.4 DRIFT** — the ledger does not reconcile. Money is being created or destroyed somewhere.
No banner means all three are clear.

You can still log in while the database is down. That is deliberate and was a real bug: the login
required a `200`, a DB-down server returns `503`, and the correct key produced "Error 503." with no
way in — locked out of the ops console in exactly the situation it exists for. `modAuth` is a pure
header compare that never touches the database, so a `503` PROVES the key was accepted (a wrong key
`401`s first) and you are let in to see the banner.

**3. If the database is unreachable**
The game server does NOT need redeploying — it recovers on its own the moment the database returns
(§7b). Check your database provider's status page first. Do not restart the API in a loop: it
refuses to boot while the database is down, so a restart turns a recoverable outage into a dead
service. This is also why `/health` must NOT be your platform's own health check (§7b).

**4. If §10.4 has drifted**
The game is still playable and players are unaffected in the moment, but stop and read it — the
per-check drift on the Integrity panel names which currency and which reconciliation failed. It has
never drifted in the built system; if it does, it is a real defect, not a rounding artifact.

**5. Where the alarms reach you**
Both the §10.4 sweep and the backup watchdog post to `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL` (Slack or Discord).
If that is unset, nothing shouts and you are relying on opening the dashboard yourself. Set it.
The Growth-loop panel has a drill button that sends a test message so you can confirm it arrives.

---

## 7c. Backups — you are told when they break, and you keep your own
**The game now watches its own backups.** Postgres ships write-ahead-log segments to the backup
service; when that stops, the database keeps serving perfectly while your ability to *restore* it
quietly rots. It is the one failure that is invisible from inside the game — and on 2026-07-25 it
happened twice in one day with the only evidence buried in the host's log stream.

- **`/admin` leads with a Backups panel** and shows a red banner when it is broken. Five states:
  `HEALTHY` (shipping), `FAILING` (the newest event was a failure — act), `QUIET` (nothing shipped
  lately, normal on an idle database), `NOT RUNNING` (**`archive_mode=off`** — there is no recovery
  chain at all), `unsupported` (dev/pg-mem, or a role that can't read the view).
- **The worker checks every tick** and alerts through the same channel as a §10.4 drift (telemetry +
  `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL`), once per episode — a healed-then-broken-again outage alerts again; a
  still-broken one doesn't re-nag hourly. **Set `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL`** or nobody gets paged.
- Note that a *healed* outage leaves its failure counts in `pg_stat_archiver` forever. What matters
  is whether the most recent event was a success — which is what the panel reports.

You can also ask the database directly:
```sql
SELECT last_archived_wal, last_archived_time, failed_count, last_failed_wal, last_failed_time
FROM pg_stat_archiver;
```
If `last_failed_time` is newer than `last_archived_time`, archiving is broken right now.

### Your own dump — `npm run backup` (cron it nightly)
```
0 4 * * * cd /path/to/repo && DATABASE_URL=postgres://… BACKUP_DIR=/backups npm run backup
```
or call the script directly:
```
0 4 * * * DATABASE_URL=postgres://… /path/to/tools/backup.sh /backups
```
It dumps to a temp name, **verifies**, and only then moves the file into place — so a run that dies
halfway leaves no truncated file wearing a plausible name. Verification is: readable by `pg_restore`,
the expected schema, `accounts`/`characters`/`transactions` present, a size floor, **and actual rows**
(a schema-only database dumps every table — 222 in the current schema — at ~200 KB: it clears every other check while holding
nothing, so only reading the data section back proves there is data in there). Retention runs **only
after a good dump**, so a run of bad nights can never age out the last known-good backup.
- exit non-zero = **no backup was kept**; the message says why. Alert on it.
- `BACKUP_MIN_ROWS=0` for a genuinely cold database (nobody has signed up yet).
- A managed platform's own backups are not a substitute — the incident that motivated this was a
  *silent* failure of exactly that (WAL archiving erroring for ~11 minutes while everything looked
  healthy). Keep an independent dump you have personally restored at least once.

#### Running it ONCE, by hand, from your own machine
Do this on **your computer, not on Render.** A Render container's disk is wiped on the next deploy, and
the point of this dump is to survive a problem *at Render* — a copy that lives there survives nothing.

You need three things:
1. **Postgres 16 client tools** (`pg_dump` + `pg_restore`). macOS: `brew install libpq` then follow the
   "add to PATH" line it prints, or install Postgres.app. Windows: the official Postgres installer.
   `pg_dump --version` must print **16 or higher** — an older client refuses to dump a newer server
   ("server version mismatch"), and Render's Postgres is 16.
2. **The EXTERNAL database URL** — Render dashboard → `omerta-db` → *Connections* → **External Database
   URL** → copy. (The internal `….internal` hostname only resolves inside Render's network, so it fails
   from your laptop with a DNS error.)
3. A terminal in the repo folder.

```bash
DATABASE_URL='<paste the external URL>' npm run backup
```
Windows PowerShell: `$env:DATABASE_URL='<url>'; npm run backup`

Success looks exactly like this (measured, not paraphrased):
```
dumping…
verifying…
backup verified: ./backups/omerta-20260726-123716.dump (194085 bytes, 161 tables)   # an example run from 2026-07 — the table count grows with the schema (222 today)
restore with: pg_restore --no-owner --clean --if-exists -d <target> ./backups/omerta-…dump
```
If it instead says `'accounts' holds 0 rows … expected ≥ 1`, it dumped an EMPTY database — almost always
the wrong `DATABASE_URL`. Only add `BACKUP_MIN_ROWS=0` if the game genuinely has no players yet; adding
it to silence the message is how you end up holding a backup of nothing.

The file lands in `./backups/` mode 0600. **It is a complete copy of the database** — accounts, wallet
addresses, the entire ledger — so treat it like a password: keep it off shared drives and out of git
(`backups/` is already ignored).

**The script has its own regression test** — `npm run backup:selftest`, pointed at a throwaway
Postgres it may create and drop databases on. It builds a populated database, a schema-only one and a
non-OMERTÀ one, and proves each check *refuses what it should*: a verification that cannot fail is
decoration. CI runs it against a real Postgres on every push, and that has already earned itself —
it caught a **race in the verifier that refused GOOD dumps**. The required-table check piped into
`grep -q` under `pipefail`; `grep -q` exits at the first match and SIGPIPEs the writer still emitting
the rest of a ~34 KB table of contents, so a *successful* match returned 141 and the backup was
rejected with "table X is missing" about a table that was plainly there. It never reproduced on a
developer machine and fired on every CI run, blaming a different table each time. Fails closed (a bad
dump is never kept in place of a good one), but a cron that starts refusing good backups with an
untrue reason is its own incident. If you ever see that message, check the table really is absent
before believing it.

#### Rehearsing the restore — do this ONCE, now, not on the bad night
Everything above proves the dump is *readable*. It does not prove **you** can turn it back into a
running game, and that is the only property that matters. A backup nobody has restored is a hope with
a filename. The first restore should not be attempted under pressure, at night, with players waiting
— rehearse it while nothing is wrong and the outcome does not matter.

It restores into a **scratch database on your own machine**. Nothing touches production, so there is
nothing here you can break.

```bash
# 1. a throwaway target — any local Postgres 16
createdb omerta_restore_drill

# 2. restore the dump you just took (30s–2min depending on size)
pg_restore --no-owner --clean --if-exists -d omerta_restore_drill ./backups/omerta-<stamp>.dump

# 3. did the people and the money come back?
psql -d omerta_restore_drill -c \
  "SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM accounts) accounts,
          (SELECT count(*) FROM characters) characters,
          (SELECT count(*) FROM transactions) ledger_rows;"

# 4. does the GAME run on it? this is the real test — schema present is not the same as usable
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/omerta_restore_drill JWT_SECRET=drill \
  MOD_KEY=drill-mod-key-long-enough MARKET_SEED='<your real MARKET_SEED>' npm run invariants

# 5. clean up
dropdb omerta_restore_drill
```

Step 4 is the one people skip and the one that counts: it boots the real server against the restored
copy and runs the §10.4 sweep over it. Every identity holding means the ledger came back *coherent*,
not merely present.

Use your **real `MARKET_SEED`** for the drill. It is the secret behind every price and prize draw, so
a restore with the wrong seed would produce a game whose economy silently disagrees with the one your
players were living in — which is worth knowing now rather than discovering mid-recovery.

**A successful restore is completely silent.** Measured, not assumed — `--if-exists` is exactly what
suppresses the "cannot drop, does not exist" errors `--clean` would otherwise raise on an empty
database, so step 2 prints nothing at all and exits 0. Anything it does print is worth reading rather
than waving through. (An earlier draft of this section said to expect that noise. It was wrong, and
wrong in the direction that gets people hurt: told to expect errors, you learn to ignore the real one.)

The whole rehearsal, run end to end on 2026-07-26 against a dump of a live database: restore silent,
step 3 returned the true counts, step 4 came back `"ok": true` with every §10.4 identity at drift 0.

## 8. Post-deploy smoke check
- [ ] `GET /health` → `200 {"ok":true,"db":"up"}`.
- [ ] `GET /v1/session` → 200 (server up).
- [ ] Boot log shows `[db] Postgres ready` (NOT `[db] pg-mem …` — that means `DATABASE_URL` was missing).
- [ ] `POST /v1/auth/guest` → token; `POST /v1/character {name}` → 200; `POST /v1/crimes/pick` → a result.
- [ ] `GET /admin` (with the `x-mod-key`) → the ops dashboard; the §10.4 banner reads **OK** (drift-0).
- [ ] `npm run invariants` (or `GET /v1/mod/invariants`) → every check `ok:true`.
- [ ] Confirm the worker logged a tick (and, after 12h, a buyback).

## 8b. SLOs — the numbers a monitor holds us to (bulletproof audit, 2026-08-21)
A target nobody wrote down is a target nobody is missing. These are the service-level objectives, each
readable off `GET /health` (which now carries request-side SLIs: `load.req5m` / `load.err4xx5m` /
`load.err5xx5m` / `load.p95Ms` / `load.maxMs`, plus `rssMb` and `worker.beatAgoSeconds`):

| SLI (where to read it)                    | SLO                       | What a miss means / first move |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `/health` returns 200 (uptime monitor)    | ≥ 99.5% monthly (~3.6h budget) | DB down or box down — §7b runbook |
| `load.p95Ms` (recent-request latency)     | < 500ms sustained         | pool cliff or DB CPU — §2's PG_POOL_MAX note; the DB plan is the dial |
| `load.err5xx5m`                            | 0 (a 5xx is a BUG — 4xx are ordinary gameplay refusals) | read the `[500]` log lines (each carries route + message) |
| `worker.beatAgoSeconds` / `worker.stale`  | < 5400s / never `stale:true` | the worker is dark: every alarm + timed settlement stopped — restart it |
| `/admin` Backups panel                    | `HEALTHY`                 | §7c — archiving broke; PITR is rotting while everything looks fine |
| `rssMb`                                    | flat over days (± tens of MB) | a steady creep is a memory leak — restart buys time, then diagnose |

**Provision the uptime monitor (one-time, ~5 minutes):** point any free monitor (UptimeRobot,
BetterStack) at `GET https://<your-host>/health`, alert on non-200, 1–5 min interval. Add a keyword
alert on `"stale":true` if the monitor supports it — that is the worker going dark, which no status
code shows. Do NOT make `/health` the *platform's* health check (§7b: restarting the API does not fix
a database). The endpoint is cached ~2s + single-flight server-side, so monitor frequency is free.

## 8c. Rolling back a bad deploy
Render keeps every previous deploy. To roll back: **Render dashboard → the service → Deploys → pick
the last good deploy → "Rollback to this deploy" — and do it on BOTH services** (`omerta-api` AND
`omerta-worker`), to the SAME commit: the two ship from one repo and a split-version pair is a state
nothing is tested against.

**Why rolling back is safe here, and the one rule that keeps it safe:** the schema is ADDITIVE-ONLY —
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + derived `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, never `DROP`/`RENAME`/type-change
migrations — so an older build running against a newer schema simply ignores columns it doesn't know.
Keep it that way: a destructive migration is what turns "click rollback" into "restore from backup".
Each boot stamps `schema_meta` with the build version that applied the schema; **a rolled-back (older)
build detects the newer stamp, logs a `⚠ … likely a rollback in progress` line, and deliberately does
not overwrite it** — so the stamp always names the newest schema the database has seen. A rollback
undoes CODE, never data: if bad data was written, fix forward (a mod route or SQL with a ledger row),
don't expect the rollback to unwrite it.

**Blueprint drift is its own rollback trap:** any dashboard change (plan, HA toggle) must be written
into `render.yaml` in the same sitting — a drifted blueprint silently stops EVERY later change to
that file (including deploy-gating config) from reaching Render. The 16-day incident is documented at
the top of `render.yaml`; the lesson is one sentence: the file must match the dashboard, both ways.

## 8d. Cloudflare in front — one move that buys CDN, edge caching, DDoS and a WAF (optional)
The app is a single always-on origin; putting Cloudflare's free tier in front (orange-cloud the DNS
record) buys four of the classic production layers in one step, with two rules:

- **Cache static, NEVER the API.** Safe to cache aggressively: `/art/*`, `/v1/art/*`, `/v1/avatar/*`
  (already served with long/immutable cache headers — Cloudflare respects them by default). Add a
  cache rule to BYPASS everything else under `/v1/*` — every other board is per-player or
  fast-moving, and an edge-cached `/v1/me` would hand one player another's sheet. WebSockets
  (`/v1/ws`) pass through on all plans.
- **Set `TRUST_PROXY=2`** (the env now takes a hop count): the chain becomes client → Cloudflare →
  Render LB → app, and the default `on` (=1 hop) would read Cloudflare's egress IP as the client —
  every per-IP throttle collapses onto ~a dozen shared addresses. Verify after flipping: the IPs in
  `/v1/mod/actions` (mod audit log) should be real client addresses, not `104.x`/`172.6x` Cloudflare
  ranges.

Without Cloudflare, DDoS/WAF is Render's platform layer + the in-app throttles (H4 default keyless
throttle, per-IP auth buckets, the security-header baseline) — adequate for launch scale; the
Cloudflare move is the cheap upgrade when traffic or abuse says so.

## 8e. Disaster recovery — the secrets are part of the backup
A database dump restores the WORLD, but three env values are unrecoverable-by-construction if lost,
and losing them is losing something real:

- **`JWT_SECRET`** — lost = every player logged out (they can log back in; sessions die).
- **`MARKET_SEED`** — lost = every §7.11 seeded draw (prices, numbers, track, contracts) changes
  discontinuously. The game survives, but open seeded bets settle against a different draw.
- **`MOD_KEY`** — lost = no admin access until it is rotated.

**One-time step:** copy all three out of the Render dashboard (env group `omerta-secrets`) into the
founder's password manager. Render generated them (`generateValue: true`), so the dashboard is
currently the ONLY copy — a deleted env group or a destroyed account currently takes them with it.
Chain-era secrets (`VOUCHER_SIGNER_PK`, bot keys) get the same treatment the day they are set.

**Stated RPO/RTO:** managed PITR (watched by §7c) targets minutes of data loss; the nightly
`npm run backup` dump is the independent floor — worst case, one day (RPO ≤ 24h) restored in under an
hour (§7c's rehearsed restore, measured 2026-07-26). **The nightly dump must run somewhere with
`pg_dump` + durable storage** — a laptop cron, a VPS, a GitHub Action with an artifact store. NOT a
Render cron service: those containers have no persistent disk, so a dump written there evaporates
with the container. If the dump destination is third-party storage, encrypt it first
(`gpg -c` on the file) — it contains every player's email-free but complete game state.

**`DATABASE_URL` rule:** always the INTERNAL connection string (the `fromDatabase` blueprint wiring
already does this). The external string traverses the public internet and counts against connection
limits; nothing in this stack needs it except your own laptop running a restore rehearsal.

## 9. Still gated (NOT part of the off-chain alpha)
Mainnet / on-chain extraction — `forge test` on a real toolchain, the third-party audit of the contracts
**and** the off-chain signer, and the launch checklist on the Risk-to-Earn / RWA line. See CLAUDE.md + `SIGN-OFF.md`.
Founder balance sign-offs (`BALANCE.md` / `SIGN-OFF.md`) are numbers, not blockers, for the alpha.

## 3c. Seasonal League Modifiers (slate #6) — ARMED by default since 2026-08-02
The once-per-season seed-drawn rule twist (the pool in `rules.js SEASON_MODS`) is LIVE with no env
var set — the founder signed the pool as part of the strategy package (BALANCE.md § THE STRATEGY
PACKAGE). It deliberately modifies SIGNED levers (laylow, law-gain, kill loot, safehouse, goods
sell) for a 28-day season at a time; one season in four is vanilla so the baseline stays felt.
**`SEASON_MODS=off` is the kill switch** — it reverts every season to "Dead Quiet" (the signed
baseline) with no code change, and it is regression-tested. `SEASON_MOD=<id>` is a test-only pin
that forces one season — never in production (the boot guard rejects it).
