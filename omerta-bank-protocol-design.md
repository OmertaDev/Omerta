# THE BANK — OMERTÀ as a dual game / DeFi protocol

*Founder-directed 2026-08-10. A synthesis of **Alchemix** (self-repaying loans), **Inverse
Finance / DOLA + FiRM** (a debt-backed stablecoin and the security architecture its two 2022
exploits forced), and **Monolith Market** (free-vs-paid debt, redemptions as peg defense, an
autonomous rate controller). Deployed on Robinhood Chain (EVM, chain ID 4663, Arbitrum Orbit,
ETH gas). The player-facing surface is the **Bank** tab.*

**This supersedes the first draft of this document (PR #26), which split the ask into an in-game
mechanic and a blocked on-chain protocol. That framing was wrong: the founder's direction is one
protocol that is simultaneously a game system and a real DeFi protocol.**

**NAMING (founder-directed 2026-08-13): the USD market's debt token is `Denari` — symbol `DNR`.**
This document (and every audit report before that date) drafted it as the generic `nUSD`; the
contract, backend, tests and runbooks are renamed, and the working name survives only in
point-in-time records. "Denari" is the Italian word for money — the coins suit of the Italian
deck; the near-miss "Dinari" was rejected for colliding with a real tokenized-securities company.
The ETH market's future debt token (`nETH` below) keeps its working name until it is founder-named.

## 0. What this is

The Bank tab stops being play money and becomes the front-end of a real protocol:

1. A player deposits **ETH or a high-quality stablecoin** (USDC/USDG) — *founder-constrained
   2026-08-10: those are the only collateral types, chosen for depth and low liquidity risk.*
2. The collateral is deployed into vetted yield.
3. The player borrows our stablecoin against it at high LTV and **near-zero nominal rate**.
4. **The yield repays the debt.** The player never makes a payment.
5. **Protocol profit routes back into the game** — split to NFT holders, and/or used to buy $OMR
   on the open market and hand it to free players.

Step 5 is the part that makes this a *dual* system rather than a DeFi protocol with a game
attached. It is also, structurally, the safest thing in the design — see §4.

## 1. What we take from each source, and what each one's scars teach

### 1.1 Alchemix — the self-repaying mechanic

**Architecture** (v2, from the [C4 audit target](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix)):
`AlchemistV2` holds accounts and issues debt; balances are held as **shares** of a yield token —
an accounting abstraction whose stated purpose is to *"avoid bank-run scenarios"*; debt is a
signed `int256` so credit and debt are one field. `TransmuterV2` is the peg: any holder exchanges
the debt token for underlying **1:1**. `TransmuterBuffer` sits between them, buffering the flow
from `repay()`, `liquidate()` and `harvest()` with configurable rate limits.

**The two findings that forced redesign** ([Runtime Verification, 7 weeks, Jan
2022](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/alchemix-v2-audit-and-reviewed-code-fixes)):
1. **Large depositors could obtain an unfair advantage** in the accounting.
2. **The Transmuter had to be guaranteed solvent even if the backing yield token unexpectedly
   lost value.**

Finding 2 is the one to internalise. *A 1:1 redemption promise is only as good as the worst day of
the asset behind it.* Alchemix's answer was the buffer plus flow limits; ours is §2.4.

Alchemix later encoded the audit's invariants **in Solidity for fuzzing** — the practice this
project already follows (`forge test`, 128 tests, two 512-run fuzzes), so it is the standard our
batch must meet, not an aspiration.

**Also on the record:** Alchemix was hit for ~$13M in the July 2023 Curve/Vyper reentrancy
incident — *not a flaw in Alchemix's own code*, but in a pool it depended on. That is the
composability tax, and it is an argument for §2.6's isolation rule.

### 1.2 Inverse Finance — the stablecoin, and two very expensive lessons

DOLA is a debt-backed stablecoin: supply expands only when someone borrows it against collateral.
That is the right model and we adopt it.

**But Inverse was drained twice in 2022, and both were the same bug in different clothes:**

| Date | Loss | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **2 Apr 2022** | ~**$15.6M** | The Keep3r **TWAP oracle for INV** was manipulated via the INV/WETH Sushiswap pool. The attacker borrowed 1,588 ETH, 94 WBTC, ~4M DOLA and 39 YFI against INV worth far less. |
| **16 Jun 2022** | ~**$5.8M** protocol loss | Flash-borrowed 27,000 wBTC into Curve's tricrypto pool, inflating the **yvCurve-3Crypto LP price**, then borrowed DOLA against it. |

**Both are oracle manipulation of thin, manipulable collateral** — their own governance token in
the first case, a leveraged LP token in the second. There is also a [March 2026 DOLA manipulation
incident (~$240K)](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2026/03/02/inversefinance-faces-240k-loss-in-dola-manipulation-alert/),
so the class is live, not historical.

**FiRM is their rewrite, and it is a catalogue of the right answers:**
- **Personal Collateral Escrows** — every user's collateral sits in **its own contract**, never a
  shared pool. *"There is no single, centralized pool for attackers to target."*
- **Pessimistic price oracles** (worst recent price, not spot).
- **Daily borrowing limits** — a cap on damage per block-window even if everything else fails.
- **Flash-loan protection.**
- **DBR** (DOLA Borrowing Rights): a token = the right to borrow 1 DOLA for 1 year, which makes
  borrowing fixed-rate. Its cleverest property: force-replenishment prices DBR **at a deliberate
  premium so the protocol never has to consult an oracle about DBR at all.** *The best oracle is
  the one you removed.*

### 1.3 Monolith — the peg mechanism that needs no liquidator

Monolith's [factory](https://docs.monolith.market/) deploys an immutable stablecoin per
(collateral, price feed). Its distinctive move is **two borrowing modes**:

- **Free debt — 0% interest, but redeemable.** Any Coin holder can
  [redeem](https://docs.monolith.market/protocol/redemptions.md) against your position at oracle
  price **+ a fee** (0.3% in their example), **pro-rata across all free-debt holders** — hold 40%
  of free debt, absorb 40% of the redemption. Your debt falls by exactly what was redeemed, and
  **the fee stays with you**, so being redeemed against is compensated, not punitive.
- **Paid debt — a variable rate, and untouchable by redemptions.** That interest is what funds the
  **sToken** staking vault.

An **autonomous rate controller** ties them together: if the free-debt share falls below target
the paid rate *rises* (pushing borrowers into free debt, deepening redemption liquidity); if it
runs high the rate *decays toward a floor*. **The rate is a peg-defense instrument, not a revenue
knob** — that is the insight worth stealing.

Why this matters for us: redemption is a **price floor that works when DEX liquidity does not**.
Any holder can always get $1 of collateral for 1 Coin. No liquidator, no keeper, no auction.

---

## 2. The architecture

### 2.1 THE DECISION THAT REMOVES LIQUIDATIONS ENTIRELY

The founder's ETH/USDC-only constraint enables the strongest structural choice available, and it
should be taken deliberately rather than stumbled into:

> **Match the debt's denomination to the collateral's denomination, and price risk — therefore
> liquidation, therefore the oracle on the borrow path — disappears.**

This is precisely why Alchemix runs `alUSD` against DAI/USDC and `alETH` against ETH/stETH, and
never one against the other. So we run **two isolated markets**:

| Market | Collateral | Debt token | Price risk | Liquidations | Oracle on borrow path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The Vault** | USDC / USDG | **`Denari` (`DNR`)** (USD-denominated) | none | **none** | **none** |
| **The Ledger** | ETH / wstETH | **`nETH`** (ETH-denominated) | none | **none** | **none** |

**A cross-denominated market (ETH collateral → USD debt) is exactly the shape that lost Inverse
$21M and it is out of scope.** If it is ever wanted, it is a separate market with a separate risk
budget, its own oracle stack, and its own audit — never a parameter change to these two.

The consequence is worth stating plainly: **there is no price at which a user in either market is
liquidated.** Their debt only ever falls. That is a *better product* than any competitor offering
"low liquidation risk," and it is achieved by removing the mechanism rather than tuning it.

### 2.2 Self-repaying, and the honest timescale

Debt repays from yield on the **full** collateral, so `T = LTV ÷ yield`:

| Yield | 50% LTV | 80% LTV | 90% LTV |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3% (organic stable) | 16.7 yrs | 26.7 yrs | 30 yrs |
| 5% | 10 yrs | 16 yrs | 18 yrs |
| 7% (incentivised) | 7.1 yrs | 11.4 yrs | 12.9 yrs |

**This is not a flaw to be engineered away — it is what self-repaying means, and Alchemix ships it
at ~50% LTV for this reason.** The product requirement it creates is a *copy* requirement: the UI
must show the **actual projected payoff date from the live realised yield**, recomputed as the
yield moves, and must never use a phrase implying speed. The mechanic's honesty is the feature;
a user who understands "this repays itself over years, and I am never liquidated meanwhile" is
getting a genuinely good deal. One who was told "self-repaying" and expected months is a
complaint and an exhibit.

At the founder's requested 80–90% LTV against stables, the collateral is USD and the debt is USD,
so high LTV carries *no liquidation risk* — the only cost is that repayment takes longer. **90% is
therefore defensible here in a way it never is in a cross-denominated market.** The binding
constraint on LTV becomes the Transmuter's solvency (§2.4), not price.

### 2.3 Free debt and paid debt (Monolith), which is also the game's difficulty setting

Both markets carry Monolith's two modes, and they map onto the noir fiction with no strain:

- **"On the arm"** (free debt, 0%) — you owe nothing in interest, but the house can call on your
  collateral: any `DNR` holder may redeem against you at oracle price + fee, pro-rata with the
  other free-debt borrowers, **and you keep the fee**.
- **"On the books"** (paid debt, variable) — you pay a rate and nobody can touch your collateral.

The autonomous controller targets a free-debt **share**, not a revenue number. Paid-debt interest
funds the staking vault (`sDNR` / `snETH`), which is the sToken, which is one of the two profit
legs in §4.

This is a real decision with a real tradeoff, which is exactly what the game's own strategy pass
says the mid-game lacks — and here it is the *same* decision for a DeFi user and a player.

### 2.4 The Transmuter, and Runtime Verification's finding #2

`DNR` redeems 1:1 for underlying through a Transmuter fed by `repay()`, `liquidate()` and
`harvest()`, buffered with flow limits (the Alchemix shape). RV's finding was that this promise
must survive the backing yield token losing value. Our answers:

1. **Denomination matching** (§2.1) removes the price leg of that risk in the first place.
2. **A hard buffer floor.** The Transmuter must hold ≥ `BUFFER_FLOOR_BPS` of outstanding claims
   in *underlying*, not yield-bearing form. Below it, new borrowing halts before redemption does —
   **the protocol stops issuing before it stops paying.**
3. **Flow rate limits** on buffer→Transmuter, so a single block cannot drain the queue.
4. **Invariant, checked and fuzzed:** `Σ DNR supply ≤ Σ collateral value × LTV` at all times.

### 2.5 The security architecture — FiRM's answers, adopted wholesale

| Vector | Our structural answer |
|---|---|
| Oracle manipulation (the $21M class) | **No oracle on the borrow path at all** in either market (§2.1). Oracles appear only in the redemption price, and only for ETH/USD and USDC/USD — the deepest feeds in existence. Chainlink + a **pessimistic** (worst-of-recent) read, per FiRM. |
| A single pool to drain | **Personal Collateral Escrows.** One escrow contract per (user, market). No co-mingling. This is FiRM's central lesson and it is not optional. |
| Flash loans | Escrow deposits and borrows in the same transaction are blocked; a **daily per-market borrow cap** bounds worst-case damage even if everything above fails. |
| A dependency's bad day (the Curve/Vyper class) | §2.6. |
| Whale accounting advantage (RV finding #1) | Shares accounting with the audit's fix, plus fuzzed invariants on credit accrual. |
| Governance key compromise | Safe-owned, **compile-time hard caps** on every economic ceiling (the `OmertaBond MAX_DISCOUNT_BPS` discipline already in this repo), so a stolen key cannot raise LTV, mint, or redirect revenue. |

### 2.6 Yield deployment, and the isolation rule

Deposits earn through vetted strategies (Steakhouse/Morpho USDG, Spark, Maple, Ethena as
available on Robinhood Chain — see PR #26 §3.2 for the basket mapping and hard caps, which stand).
Two rules that are structural, not advisory:

1. **One strategy per isolated market; no strategy failure may propagate to another.** Alchemix's
   $13M came from a pool it depended on, not its own code.
2. **Size against organic yield, never incentivised yield.** A sleeve's weight is a function of
   yield *net of incentives* so an incentive ending rebalances automatically. Looping stays out of
   the default basket: a ~92bp spread levered into the teens is a bet that a subsidy continues, and
   if it inverts a "self-repaying" loan begins **growing**.

### 2.7 $OMR as collateral — the sequencing, and the exact conditions

*Founder, 2026-08-10: "Maybe we will take OMR as an experimental down the line when the backing of
it is deeper due to bonding thickening and auto compounding the LP."*

**The instinct is right and the reason is on the record: `INV`-as-collateral in Inverse's own money
market is what was drained for $15.6M.** A protocol accepting its own token as collateral is the
single most attacked shape in DeFi. So it is deferred — and rather than leave "deeper LP" as a
judgment call later, the gate is these five conditions, all met simultaneously:

1. POL depth such that the cost to move OMR/ETH ±10% exceeds the market's **entire** borrow cap.
2. A **Chainlink or equivalent independent** feed — never a DEX TWAP of our own pool (that is
   literally the April 2022 setup).
3. Its own **isolated** market with a hard supply cap, sized as a small fraction of protocol
   equity — a total loss must be survivable.
4. **Pessimistic oracle + a per-day borrow cap** below the manipulation cost in (1).
5. A dedicated audit of that market. Not a parameter change.

### 2.8 The OMR-WETH LP position — staking YES, collateral NO (and why the yes unlocks the no)

*Founder, 2026-08-10: "Maybe also allow the OMR-WETH LP position to be used as collateral or stake
it to earn fees from LP."*

**These are two very different asks and they get opposite answers.**

**STAKE IT FOR FEES — yes, and it should be built early.** An LP staking contract that accrues and
auto-compounds trading fees has *no oracle on any path, no borrow, no liquidation, and no
manipulation surface*, because nobody is lending against anything. It is a distribution contract.
It also does something strategically valuable: **auto-compounding thickens the POL**, which is
condition (1) of §2.7's gate. So the safe half of this idea is literally the machinery that earns
the right to consider the dangerous half — build it first, and it compounds toward its own
precondition.

**AS COLLATERAL — no, and it is the strictest no in this document.** An OMR-WETH LP position is
**both** of the attacks that drained Inverse, stacked:

| Their loss | Collateral | Our LP position |
|---|---|---|
| Jun 2022, ~$5.8M | `yvCurve-3Crypto` — **an LP token**, flash-loaned into a fake price | it is an LP token |
| Apr 2022, ~$15.6M | `INV` — **the protocol's own token**, TWAP-manipulated | it holds our own token |

The naive LP valuation — `(r₀·p₀ + r₁·p₁) / totalSupply` from spot reserves — is manipulable by
anyone with a flash loan, which is exactly the June 2022 mechanic. There **is** a manipulation-
resistant formula (the fair-LP / Alpha Finance pricing):

```
P_LP  =  2 · √(k · p₀ · p₁) / totalSupply        where k = r₀·r₁ is the pool invariant
```

It works because `k` does **not** move under a swap — a flash loan changes the reserves and leaves
the invariant alone — so the price it returns is the un-manipulated one. **But it requires an
INDEPENDENT price for both sides.** WETH has Chainlink. `$OMR`'s only price is our own pool. Feed
that back in and you have rebuilt April 2022 with extra steps.

**So the gate is §2.7's, and the LP inherits it rather than getting its own softer one** — plus two
conditions specific to being an LP:

6. **Fair-LP pricing only** (the formula above), never spot-reserve valuation, with the independent
   $OMR feed of §2.7(2) as the hard prerequisite — no feed, no market.
7. **If the canonical pool is Uniswap v3/v4, the answer stays no regardless.** A concentrated
   position is an NFT with a range, can sit entirely on one side of the tick, and has no clean
   `totalSupply` to divide by; the fair-LP formula does not apply to it. Only a full-range v2-style
   position is even a candidate.

**What ships instead, and it is not a consolation prize:** LP staking + auto-compounding, whose
yield is real trading fees rather than an incentive that can end (§2.6's rule), and which
mechanically drives toward the depth that makes every later question easier.

### 2.9 Staking for in-game benefit — and the wall it must not cross

*Founder, 2026-08-10: "users can stake OMR-WETH collateral somewhere for some sort of benefit not
to be used as part of the loans or stablecoins… also an OMR single staking… maybe XP multiplier."*

Both are safe, and the framing ("not part of the loans or stablecoins") is the right instinct — it
keeps these entirely off §2.1's borrow path, so nothing here touches an oracle, a liquidation, or
the Transmuter.

**THE WALL, FIRST — an XP multiplier must never reach the city leg's `ACTIVITY` score.** This is
the one way the idea could go wrong and it is not obvious. §4.2.1 distributes the bought-$OMR pool
pro-rata on activity. If staked $OMR multiplied that score, then:

> staked $OMR → higher score → a larger share of the $OMR distribution → more $OMR

…a self-referential loop in which **holding the token buys a bigger share of the token handout.**
That would (a) make the distribution wealth-weighted rather than effort-weighted, which is *not*
what the approved "skill/effort-based" framing covers and lands it next to an open question,
and (b) destroy the linearity proof — two players with identical effort would receive different
shares based on their balance.

**It is already structurally safe, and that is now deliberate rather than lucky.** `activityScore`
computes from **action counts × base XP**, never from XP awarded, so a multiplier applied to
mastery progression cannot propagate into it. `test/activity.js` pins this directly.

So the rule: **a staking multiplier may accelerate PROGRESSION (trade levels, milestone perks,
ranks) and must never touch the DISTRIBUTION key.** Stated the way this project states these:
*staking buys the ladder faster; it never buys a bigger slice of somebody else's money.*

**(a) Single-sided $OMR — already built; this is one new column.** `MADE_LADDER` already keys on
`account_persistent.staked` with four rungs (10 / 30 / 75 / 150 $OMR → trunk, energy cap, nerve,
garage, and a fence bonus at the top two). The founder's ask is an **`xpBps` column** on those
existing rungs — a mastery-XP multiplier — not a second staking system. That fits the current
ceiling rule (power is allowed but **capped**, and the cap must be reachable without paying):
a multiplier accelerates arrival at perks that a free player also reaches, and moves no ceiling —
`MAX_LVL`, `STAT_CAP` and every perk value are untouched. **Staking buys time, not ceiling.**

**(b) OMR-WETH LP — the same ladder, weighted higher, plus real fees.** LP is worth strictly more
to the protocol than an idle single-sided stake, because depth is the thing §2.7(1) actually needs.
So an LP position counts toward the SAME ladder at `LP_STAKE.WEIGHT` × the $OMR side it contains —
one ladder, two ways onto it, no parallel benefit table to drift. On top of that it accrues **real
trading fees** (§2.8), which is a genuine yield with no faucet, no oracle and no promise attached.

**What neither may ever be:** a $OMR yield on the stake (that is a faucet *and* the
BlockFi/Celsius fact pattern), or a share of protocol revenue (that is A11). The benefit is
in-game utility and progression speed — which is precisely why it needs no new launch-checklist rows.

### 2.10 Flash loans — what can actually be done, and what is built

*Founder, 2026-08-10: "figure out how to write in the smart contract ways to kill flash loans from
happening completely."* Built as `omerta-contracts/src/FlashGuard.sol` (compiles clean, solc
0.8.26, 0 warnings).

**The honest framing first, because it changes what to build. A flash loan cannot be blocked.** It
is not a feature of one lender that we can refuse to integrate — it is a property of **EVM
atomicity**: a transaction either fully succeeds or fully reverts, so anyone can borrow inside one,
from Aave, Balancer, Morpho, Uniswap, or their own balance. There is no switch, and "is this
capital borrowed?" is not reliably observable on-chain.

**There is also no need for one, and this is the useful part: a flash loan is never the
vulnerability — it is the amplifier.** Every flash-loan "exploit" on record is really one of three
bugs: (1) a price read from a source the caller can move inside the same transaction; (2) a state
you can ENTER and EXIT in one transaction and profit from the round trip; (3) reentrancy. The loan
only makes the attacker briefly rich enough to do (1) or (2) at scale. **Remove those and a flash
loan buys nothing** — a far stronger position than trying to detect borrowed money.

**And we must not block them all anyway.** The Transmuter's 1:1 redemption is *defended* by
arbitrage — someone who flash-loans to buy `DNR` at 0.98 and redeems at 1.00 is repairing our peg
at their own gas risk. A blanket ban would disable the mechanism that keeps the peg honest. So the
guards are surgical: they attach where atomicity creates an *advantage*, never where it creates a
*service*.

**The layers, strongest first:**

| | Layer | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** | **REMOVE THE TARGET** — denomination-matched markets mean **no oracle on the borrow path at all**. A price never read cannot be manipulated, at any size. Worth more than everything below combined; both Inverse losses (~$21M) were exactly this. | §2.1 |
| **L1** | **SAME-BLOCK SEPARATION** — entry and exit cannot share a block. Not a mitigation but a *proof*: a flash loan must be repaid in the transaction that took it, so forcing the profitable half into a later block means the loan cannot still exist. Costs an honest user one block (~250ms on an Orbit L2). | `FlashGuard` |
| **L2** | **CONTRACT ALLOWLIST** — and deliberately **not** `require(msg.sender == tx.origin)`. That one-liner is now an anti-pattern: it breaks ERC-4337, Safe multisigs and every smart wallet — and Robinhood Chain's self-custody is Privy-style embedded wallets, so it would lock out exactly our users. It does not even work (an EOA can call us via a callback in the same transaction). | `FlashGuard` |
| **L3** | **TIME-WEIGHTED ACCRUAL** — rewards, shares and voting accrue over elapsed time, so a position held zero blocks earns exactly zero. | Alchemist |
| **L4** | **ORACLE HARDENING** where one is genuinely needed (the redemption price only): Chainlink rather than a DEX TWAP, read **pessimistically**, with staleness and single-block deviation breakers. | Transmuter |
| **L5** | **FLOW CAPS** — per-block and per-day. A flash loan is *by definition* one block, so a per-block cap is the tightest possible bound on any atomic exploit; the daily cap (FiRM's) bounds the patient version that would otherwise just spread out. Bounds rather than prevents — the last line. | `FlashGuard` |
| **L6** | **REENTRANCY** — `nonReentrant` plus strict checks-effects-interactions. | all |
| **L7** | **SHARE INFLATION / DONATION** — track assets in a variable, never `balanceOf(this)`, so a direct transfer cannot move the share price. (OZ 5.x virtual shares cover the classic first-depositor case; internal accounting covers the rest.) | Alchemist |

## 3. The in-game surface

The Bank tab renders the same positions a DeFi user sees, in the game's language: the vault, the
projected payoff date from live yield, the on-the-arm/on-the-books switch, the staking vault, and
the redemption queue. Two hard product rules:

- **Never a phrase implying speed or guaranteed return.** The projected payoff date is computed
  from realised yield and moves with it. No "earn", no APY promise in copy, no countdown.
- **The play-money economy and the protocol stay separate ledgers.** In-game cash never becomes
  protocol collateral and vice versa; the only value that crosses is §4, in one direction, as a
  purchase.

---

## 4. The profit flywheel — and why this leg is the safest thing here

*Founder: "Any profit our protocol makes from these will be used to split between our NFT holders
or buying OMR from the open market to bring to the game and feed the free players."*

Protocol revenue = paid-debt interest + the spread between deployed yield and what self-repayment
consumes + redemption fees. It splits three ways:

**THE SPREAD IS NOW IMPLEMENTED, founder-directed 2026-08-11 ("the greedy version").** It is a
**20% performance fee on harvest** (`Alchemist.harvestFeeBps`, Yearn's canonical number and double
Alchemix's 10%), bounded by a compile-time `MAX_HARVEST_FEE_BPS` of 3000 that a stolen key cannot
raise — the `MAX_LTV_BPS` / `MAX_DISCOUNT_BPS` discipline applied to the one lever that can turn a
self-repaying loan into a non-repaying one. Three properties, each test-pinned and each
mutation-verified:

1. **Charged on what SERVICES DEBT, never on the escrow balance.** The fee is proportional to the
   yield actually moved (`fee / (take + fee) == feeBps / BPS`); yield left compounding for the user
   is never billed, and a debt-free position is never billed at all. A fee on the standing balance
   is the management-fee antipattern — it charges repeatedly for the same money.
2. **An unset recipient disables it.** Measured by removing the guard: without it `safeTransfer` to
   the zero address reverts and **every harvest in the market fails**, so a deploy that forgot one
   address would brick the core function while looking configured.
3. **The fee can never exceed the yield it came from** (512-run fuzz over rate × yield).

**A FOURTH PROPERTY, added the same night by a red-team pass over the fee: THE LTV AND THE FEE ARE
NOT INDEPENDENT KNOBS.** A harvest removes `take + fee` of collateral but reduces debt by `take`
only, so the ceiling falls faster than the debt — and at the ceiling that is a breach whenever
`ltv > 1 − fee`. Measured before the fix at **910 > 900**: deposit 1000, let 100 of yield accrue,
borrow against the ceiling that now INCLUDES it, and any EOA calling the permissionless `harvest`
returns collateral to 1000 (ceiling 900) while debt only falls to 910. The identical sequence at a
zero fee lands at 890 ≤ 900, which is what identifies the fee as the sole cause. It is not a loss —
there is no liquidation — but `mint` and `withdraw` both refuse an unhealthy position, so a stranger
could freeze a borrower's withdrawal by calling a function anyone may call.

Both setters now enforce `ltvBps + harvestFeeBps <= BPS`, so the pair cannot be walked into an
invalid state from either side (mutation-verified in both directions).

**⚑ THE PRODUCT CONSEQUENCE, which is a founder decision rather than an implementation detail: you
can have a 90% LTV or a 20% harvest fee, not both.** At the shipped 20% fee the reachable ceiling is
**80%** — the bottom of §2.2's stated 80–90% band — and `MAX_LTV_BPS` (9000) is unreachable as
configured. Raising LTV to 90% means dropping the fee to 10%. The two live options:

| | LTV | Harvest fee | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| **As shipped** | 80% | 20% | The greedier fee; the borrow ceiling at the bottom of the band. |
| **The alternative** | 90% | 10% | Alchemix's own fee; the headline LTV the design leads with. |

**THE DESTINATION IS THE TREASURY SAFE, founder-directed 2026-08-11.** `feeRecipient` is one address
and §4 wants three legs, so the honest answer today is a COLLECTOR: the sToken is unbuilt, the NFT leg
ships at zero pending its launch-checklist row, and the city leg's buy path is design — pointing the fee at any one of
them now would be picking a leg by default rather than by decision. So it goes to the one address
that only ever RECEIVES (no hot key, no swap on a collection path — the fee is denominated in the
market's underlying, not ETH), and the three-way split becomes a policy decision about a RECORDED
balance rather than a scramble to reconstruct where money went.

That reconstruction is the actual risk, and it is why the ingest shipped in the same change as the
fee: **the bond's fourth slice reached the right wallet for months while the ledger recorded nothing
and both invariants stayed green**, because money arrived somewhere nobody counted. The fee is now
booked from the first wei — a `HarvestFeeTaken` log → `recordHarvestFee` → `bank_revenue`, idempotent
on the log key, with the anti-fabrication `txHash` gate (a QA call records the episode and books
ZERO), a declared `harvest` row in the money router, and a source-membership invariant. It is booked
in the market's UNDERLYING with the asset named, never mirrored into the ETH-denominated
`rwa_revenue` — that ledger's sum IS the vault's `allocated <= held` wall, so a USDC amount landing
there would inflate the one number that bounds what players may be owed.

**THE REDEMPTION-FEE CONTRADICTION IS RESOLVED, founder-directed 2026-08-11 ("let's do 10%").** §4
listed redemption fees as protocol revenue while §2.3 paid them to the borrower; both could not be
true. They are now split — and the split turns on the fact that TWO different things are called
redemption:

- **The Transmuter's 1:1 redemption (§2.4) is NEVER TAXED, at any rate.** It is the peg defense, and
  a fee there does not earn revenue — it **widens the peg band to the size of the fee**, because no
  arbitrageur repairs a discount smaller than the toll. At 10%, DNR trades to 0.90 and nothing pulls
  it back. This is now a WALL with a named test (`test_the_peg_redemption_is_NEVER_taxed`), because
  "we set the redemption fee to 10%" is exactly the sentence that would otherwise be applied here by
  a future reader.
- **The free-debt redemption (§2.3, Monolith, unbuilt) carries the 10%, and it is a SPLIT: the
  borrower keeps 90%, the protocol takes 10%.** §2.3's promise — being redeemed against is
  compensated, not punitive — is load-bearing: it is the entire reason anyone takes free debt, and
  free debt is what gives the redemption mechanic its liquidity. A 10% tithe leaves that intact while
  giving §4 its revenue line. It ships with the Monolith layer; there is no free/paid debt split, no
  oracle and no redeem-against-a-borrower path in the contracts today, so recording it here is the
  whole of the decision for now.

§2.2's disclosure rule does the rest of the work and becomes load-bearing rather than decorative:
the UI must show the projected payoff date from the live realised **post-fee** yield. At 50% LTV and
8% yield the fee moves payoff from 6.25 years to 7.8 — real, and disclosed by a rule that already
existed. Both of this section's open items — the destination and the redemption-fee contradiction —
were closed by the founder on 2026-08-11 and are recorded above.

| Leg | Destination | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Stakers** | `sDNR` / `snETH` holders | The sToken, Monolith's design. |
| **NFT holders** | Dynasty NFT | ⚠️ **The gated leg** — on the launch checklist. Ships at zero. |
| **The city** | **Buy $OMR on the open market → the players who play** | §4.1. |

### 4.1 THE CITY LEG — it funds the game, and only the players who play

*Founder-directed 2026-08-10: "make it so the OMR bought from the profit only funds the game the
players who play."*

Two rules, and each does real work.

**RULE 1 — the bought $OMR is exclusively for in-game distribution to players.** It never reaches
NFT holders, stakers, or the team; the other two legs are funded from the ETH/stable side of the
split and never from this one. That makes the leg a **one-way, checkable** flow rather than a
policy: `Σ $OMR bought == Σ $OMR distributed to players`, an identity the nightly runner can assert.

**RULE 2 — the recipients are defined by PLAYING, not by not-paying.** This is a change from the
earlier "free players" framing and it is better on three independent axes:

- **As game design**, it rewards engagement instead of abstention. "Free player" is a status you
  hold by doing nothing; "plays the game" is something you do.
- **Against the launch checklist**, it is the CLEARED framing verbatim — *"free-to-play players can
  EARN from that recycled pool through in-game performance… redistribution is skill/effort-based…
  never chance-weighted."* So this leg is that same distribution with a *second, better-backed*
  funding source bolted on, and **it needs no new launch-checklist rows** — only the NFT leg does.
  That is a real structural saving, not a framing trick: the distribution rule is unchanged, only the
  money behind it improved.
- **As Sybil resistance**, a farm of accounts that do not play receives nothing, because the key
  *is* the playing.

### 4.2 The distribution law — linear, uncapped, and the reason is measured

**Pro-rata linear on the activity score, with NO per-account cap.** That is not a preference; it is
the correction to a bug this project already measured and paid for (`BALANCE.md` § THE FARM,
`tools/sim.js` P9.29):

> *"`WAGE_CAP_OMR` is commented 'anti-concentration / anti-Sybil', but concentration is the*
> ***opposite*** *of Sybil. It clips the honest whale to 5 and hands the remainder to whoever runs
> more accounts — the only way around a per-individual cap is to be several individuals."*

The Street Wage's per-account cap was the thing that *created* its farm incentive. Stated as the
general law:

| Score shape | Splitting effort across N accounts | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Concave** (a per-account cap, or log-share) | **gains** | Sybil-POSITIVE — the wage's bug |
| **Linear** | gains nothing | **Sybil-NEUTRAL — correct** |
| Convex | loses | Sybil-negative, but concentrates on whales |

So: linear and uncapped. And "a player who plays more receives more" is the **founder's stated
intent**, not a leak to be patched.

**The actual Sybil bound is the game's own clocks.** The activity metric must be
**cooldown-bounded** — nerve, energy, per-action cooldowns — so the maximum any one account can
score in a day is capped by wall-clock rather than by will. Then a farm's cost is linear in N and
its reward is linear in N: **identical ROI to an honest player.** That is the best achievable
without identity, and here it is *sufficient*, because this pool is funded by borrowers — a farm
taking its proportional share of somebody else's money is simply a player.

### 4.2.1 THE METRIC, LOCKED (founder-directed 2026-08-10) — `ACTIVITY` in `src/rules.tail.js`

**A player's epoch score is the sum of mastery XP from GAME-THROTTLED actions only.** Three rules,
each pinned (`test/levers.js`) and each mutation-verified (`test/activity.js`, the 91st suite):

**(a) `TAGS` is an explicit, fail-closed allowlist — and it is the severance wall.** Raw mastery XP
was *not* safe, and the reason was found in code rather than assumed: `src/casino.js` shows the
Madame's tier-1 perk **comps the nerve on dice (:116) and blackjack (:844)**, and `sellGood` carries
no nerve/energy/cooldown check at all. So for anyone with Madame standing, den and commerce XP are
bounded only by cash and HTTP round trips — which would let **cash buy a larger share of the
bought-$OMR pool**, reopening the tokenomics-v2 severance. (The pool is fixed, so nothing is
*created* and the landing page's claim stays true — but the wall's own words are "at any price".)
The rule: **an action scores only if the GAME throttles it** — nerve, energy, a cooldown, or a hard
per-day cap. *Nobody can buy wall-clock.* 22 tags qualify; `dice`, `blackjack`, `sell` and `fill`
are excluded, each with its reason recorded at the list. A tag absent from the list scores **zero**,
so a future action contributes nothing until somebody deliberately adds it (the
`DESK.SINK_REASONS` discipline: one explicit list, default "no").

**(b) The weight is linear and uncapped** — proven, not asserted: splitting one player's effort
across three accounts yields the *identical* total (588 = 588 in the suite). Doubling effort exactly
doubles the score. The test fails by name if a cap is ever reintroduced.

**(c) `MIN_TRACKS` (3) is a GATE, not a cap.** Scoring in at least three distinct trades is
required to qualify. Measured: a 200-crime single-loop grinder scores 600 and **does not qualify**;
a broader player scoring 305 across four trades does. A gate charges a fixed cost *per account*
(Sybil-negative) and never clips an honest player's payout (which is what makes a cap
Sybil-positive). `MIN_SCORE` (25) refuses dust and is likewise a floor, never a ceiling — the suite
asserts no key in the block is even *named* like a cap.

Agent accounts qualify on the same measured-play terms as human accounts. The agent flag changes
cadence and human-faucet eligibility, not access to this skill-based economic distribution. NPC
residents remain excluded because scenery cannot receive a distribution.

**Still owed before the leg goes live:** a sim probe (P9.35) measuring the realistic daily ceiling —
the theoretical maximum is dominated by nerve regen (6/min → 8,640 nerve/day) and lands near
~9,000 XP/day for a player who spends every regenerating point, but the *realistic* engaged figure
is the number that sizes a farm's cost, and this project's rule is that faucet-adjacent numbers are
measured rather than reasoned about.

### 4.3 The rail, and why §10.4 does not move

Protocol profit → market buy → `fundReserve` → credited as **`prize:omr`**, which `invariants.js`
already documents as *"an in-game $OMR credit BACKED by hard $OMR the Vig moved into the withdrawal
reserve — admissible because real revenue backs every token."* It is machinery that exists and has been
audited; the Vig's two-sided *reserve fully backed* / *not under-funded* pair already covers the
backing from both directions.

**Wall 1 (no faucet) survives intact**, because every token handed to a player was **bought, not
printed** — and now, additionally, was bought *for* somebody who was playing. The result is
something no competitor's tokenomics does: **borrowers who pay fund the players who don't.**

### 4.4 BUILT — `src/bank.js`, `test/bank.js` (2026-08-11)

The off-chain half is live and chain-dormant, the M6 pattern: the accounting is deterministic and
testable, and on mainnet the bot does the real DEX buy and reports what it got.

- **`recordBankBuy`** — idempotent on `ref`; the per-asset root cap (`spend ≤ revenue`) read INSIDE
  the transaction so two concurrent buys cannot each see the whole budget.
- **`runCityLeg`** — one epoch, idempotent on the window; pro-rata **linear, uncapped**; the breadth
  gate and dust floor from `ACTIVITY`; agent accounts qualify and NPC residents are excluded at the source; the remainder
  rule on the last payee; `prize:omr` + `fundReserve` post-commit.
- **`runBankInvariants`** — RULE 1 (`distributed ≤ bought`) plus the books either side, wired into
  the worker's nightly `alertDrift` beside vig/bond/desk/treasury.
- **`cityPaid`** is named in BOTH halves of the Vig's reserve sandwich. That is not optional: an
  unnamed funder does not fail open, it fires **spuriously on both halves at once** (AUDIT-desk F1).

**One thing is STRICTER than the design as written, and deliberately.** A comp/QA buy (no `txHash`)
books **zero $OMR**, not merely zero spend — unlike the desk's comp, which stocks its shelf freely.
The difference is where the pool's contents can go: desk inventory is soft supply inside
`omrBuckets` that only reaches a player through a paid fill, whereas this pool's **only** exit is a
`prize:omr` mint followed by `fundReserve`, i.e. the assertion *"hard $OMR arrived and stands behind
this"*. A comp crediting here would let the server sign a real withdrawal against backing that never
existed. It is the treasury's *"a comp books ZERO units"* posture, and this is why it is that one.

**And one thing the design did not specify: an empty pool does not consume the window.**
`UNIQUE (start_day, end_day)` makes the epoch row that day's only chance, so a sweep landing at 00:05
before the day's buy must skip rather than close it empty — otherwise the day's players silently lose
a purchase that lands at noon.

`test/bank.js` asserts the split-is-neutral property directly — three accounts doing a third each
take **exactly** what one doing all of it took. Under a per-account cap that number becomes 3× larger,
which is the finding, and it is why the assertion sits ABOVE the pool-drain checks: a cap breaks
those too, so with them first the mutation never reaches the claim it is meant to test.

## 5. The contracts

One audit batch, Safe-owned, fail-closed, following this repo's existing discipline (no owner
mint, no confiscation path, compile-time caps, `forge test` + fuzzed invariants):

```
Denari.sol / NETH.sol      The debt tokens. Mint: the Alchemist for that market, only.
                         Burn: the Transmuter, only. No owner mint. No blacklist,
                         no confiscation — a confiscation path is a rug vector and
                         resets the audit clock (the OMR discipline).

Alchemist.sol            Per-market. Shares accounting (RV finding #1 fix), signed
                         int256 debt, free/paid debt modes, harvest() → debt reduction.
                         LTV is Safe-set beneath a COMPILE-TIME hard cap.

CollateralEscrow.sol     ONE PER (user, market). FiRM's central lesson. Deployed by
                         factory, holds only that user's collateral, no co-mingling.

Transmuter.sol           1:1 redemption + the buffer floor of §2.4. The only burn
                         authority. Flow-rate limited.

RateController.sol       Monolith's autonomous controller. Targets the free-debt
                         SHARE, not revenue. Bounded above and below in code.

RevenueSplitter.sol      Three-way split (§4). The NFT leg is gated behind A11 — the
                         contract ships with that leg's share settable to zero and
                         the OMR-buy + staker legs live.
```

Off-chain (`src/`): the keeper follows the bond-oracle keeper discipline already in this repo —
slippage-bounded, **fail-closed on a stale feed**, single-writer under an advisory lock, watched by
`alertDrift`, because *a silent keeper reads exactly like a quiet day* and this codebase has paid
for that lesson twice.

## 6. What the build proceeds on

The founder cleared this to be built (2026-08-10). THE BANK's four surfaces — synthetic issuance,
yield-bearing deposits, revenue distribution, custody — stay **open rows on the launch checklist**,
which is kept outside this repo. They are worth answering on their own merits regardless of the
launch, because an auditor, an exchange listing desk, an insurer and a partnership conversation will
each ask the same four.

**The product rules that hold whatever the checklist says:** no earnings/income/appreciation promises
in official copy; never distribute anything by chance; the projected-payoff-date honesty rule of §3.

---

## 7. Order of work

1. **`Denari` market, contracts + fuzzed invariants** — USDC collateral, USD debt, no oracle on the
   borrow path, personal escrows, Transmuter with the buffer floor.
2. **The Bank tab** against a testnet deployment.
3. **`nETH` market** — the same contracts, second instance.
4. **RateController + free/paid debt.**
5. **RevenueSplitter** — staker + OMR-buy legs live; NFT leg at zero pending its launch-checklist row.
   *(The OMR-buy leg's OFF-CHAIN half is BUILT — §4.4. What remains on-chain is the splitter itself
   and the market-buy bot; `recordBankBuy` is already the ingest they report to.)*
6. **Third-party audit** (this batch resets the clock that tokenomics v2 step 4 already reset).
7. **LP staking + auto-compounding** (§2.8) — no oracle, no borrow, no liquidation; it
   compounds toward the POL depth §2.7(1) requires, so it is early rather than late.
8. **$OMR collateral** — only against §2.7's five conditions, with its own audit. **The
   OMR-WETH LP position inherits all five plus §2.8's two**, and is a flat no on a
   concentrated-liquidity pool whatever the depth.

**Not on this list, deliberately: cross-denominated markets, looping in the default basket, and
any path by which in-game play affects protocol yield.**
