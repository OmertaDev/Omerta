/// @title Denari (DNR) — the debt token of THE BANK's USD market
/// @notice Design: `omerta-bank-protocol-design.md` §2.1 / §5. Founder-named 2026-08-13
///         ("Denari" — the Italian word for money, the coins suit of the Italian deck; the
///         near-miss "Dinari" was rejected for colliding with a real tokenized-securities company).
///         Deploy with name "Denari", symbol "DNR" — the constructor takes both.
///
///         ── WHAT THIS TOKEN IS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         A borrower's claim, not a currency we sell. In the intended configuration the Alchemist
///         mints against escrowed collateral and the Transmuter burns on redemption. The owner can
///         replace either authority, so that configuration is a Safe trust assumption rather than
///         an immutable restriction on how supply can change.
///
///         ── TWO AUTHORITIES, EACH SINGULAR AND FAIL-CLOSED ────────────────────────────────────
///         `minter`  — the Alchemist for this market, and only it.
///         `burner`  — the Transmuter for this market, and only it.
///         Both default to `address(0)`, which is OFF: the token ships inert and the Safe arms it
///         after the market is wired. That is the GearVault cap discipline (fail-closed at zero)
///         and the OMR `minter` discipline, applied to both directions.
///
///         Setting either to `address(0)` afterwards is a one-transaction emergency stop —
///         `setMinter(0)` halts all issuance without touching redemption, which is the correct
///         asymmetry: **the protocol must stop issuing before it stops paying** (§2.4). Do not
///         "improve" this into a pause modifier that covers both.
///
///         ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, AND MUST STAY ABSENT ─────────────────────────────────
///         • **No direct owner mint.** The owner can nevertheless appoint itself or another address
///           as minter, then issue arbitrary supply. A replacement burner can burn arbitrary accounts
///           without allowance. Safe compromise therefore compromises both supply and balances.
///         • **No blacklist, transfer freeze, or forced transfer entry point.** The configured
///           burner still has balance-destruction authority as described above. Changes to these
///           trust boundaries require a new scoped review under SECURITY-REVIEW-POLICY.md.
///         • **No upgradeability.** No proxy, no admin slot.
///         • **No rebasing, no fee-on-transfer.** Integrators may assume `transfer(x)` moves
///           exactly `x`; a debt token that lies about its own transfers breaks every downstream
///           accounting assumption, including our own Transmuter's.
