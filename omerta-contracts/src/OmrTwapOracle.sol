/// @title OmrTwapOracle — a Uniswap V2 cumulative-price TWAP for the OMR/WETH pool.
/// @notice Feeds OmertaBond's accretion wall (v2 §4). A TWAP and not a spot read, because this
///         number sits on a MINT path: a spot price can be moved and restored inside one block by
///         anyone with a flash loan, so a spot-priced mint wall is not a wall.
///
///         HOW IT WORKS. A V2 pair accumulates `price*CumulativeLast` — the integral of price over
///         time. Two snapshots give the exact time-weighted average across the interval, with no
///         storage on the pair's side and no trust in whoever reads it. `update()` closes an
///         interval and is permissionless: anyone may poke it, and the worst a hostile poker can do
///         is close the window at a moment of their choosing — which is exactly why `PERIOD` is a
///         MINIMUM. Manipulating a TWAP means holding the price away from the market for the whole
///         window, in public, against arbitrageurs, and the cost scales with the window.
///
///         OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENT — THIS IS NOT SELF-DRIVING. `update()` must be poked by a keeper
///         at least once per `maxOracleAge` (the bond's staleness bound), or the reading goes stale
///         and bonding stops. That failure direction is deliberate: a dead keeper must halt the mint,
///         never open it. See CHAIN-DEPLOY.md.
///
///         FEE-ON-TRANSFER IS FINE HERE. OMR taxes transfers INTO the pair, so a seller delivers
///         less than they sent — that moves the price a TRADER receives, not the pool's own reserve
///         ratio, which is what the cumulative price integrates. The TWAP reads the pool price
///         correctly with the tax armed. (It is also why canonical liquidity must be V2 and not V3.)
///
///         WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROMISE. A TWAP is manipulation-RESISTANT, not manipulation-PROOF: a
///         sufficiently funded adversary can push a thin pool for a full window. That is why the
///         wall above composes this with `OmertaBond.maxOmrPerEth`, an absolute Safe-set ceiling the
///         oracle cannot raise. The oracle can only ever make the mint wall TIGHTER. Read
///         OmertaBond's header for why that composition, and not the oracle alone, is the guarantee.
