/// @title CollateralEscrow — one per (user, market). No co-mingling, ever.
/// @notice Design: `omerta-bank-protocol-design.md` §2.5. This is FiRM's central lesson and the
///         design records it as "not optional."
///
///         ── WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT DELETES A WHOLE BUG CLASS ─────────────────────────────
///         Alchemix pools every depositor's collateral into shared yield positions and tracks each
///         user's claim as internal SHARES. Runtime Verification's finding #1 against that design
///         was an accounting advantage available to large depositors — the kind of rounding bug
///         that only exists because a pool has to be divided.
///
///         **We do not divide a pool, because there is no pool.** Each user's collateral sits in
///         their own contract at their own address. Their position is a concrete token balance, not
///         a fraction of anything. So RV finding #1 is not *fixed* here — it is **unreachable**,
///         which is a strictly stronger property and the reason the design's own mention of shares
///         accounting was dropped rather than implemented.
///
///         The escrow holds the EXTERNAL yield vault's ERC-4626 shares. Those are that vault's
///         shares, not ours — one balance, one owner, no internal share price for us to round.
///         A depositor's realizable value is the growth of fee-aware `previewRedeem` on the shares they alone
///         hold, so one user's rounding can never move another user's balance: there is no shared
///         denominator between them.
///
///         ── THE TRUST MODEL, STATED PLAINLY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         The escrow is DUMB. It holds tokens and obeys exactly one controller, set once at
///         construction and never changeable. All policy — loan-to-value, caps, timing — lives in
///         the Alchemist. That split is deliberate: it means auditing "can a user's collateral be
///         taken?" is reading this ~90-line file, not the whole protocol.
///
///         There is deliberately **no sweep, no rescue, no owner withdrawal**. A sweep is how an
///         escrow becomes a rug vector, and "recover a mistakenly-sent token" is not worth a
///         function that can move value out on a non-user's say-so. Tokens sent here directly by
///         mistake are lost; that is the correct trade for a contract whose entire job is custody.
