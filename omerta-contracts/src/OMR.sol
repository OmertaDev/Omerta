/// @title OMR — OMERTÀ's utility token.
/// @notice An initial supply minted once to the treasury Safe, plus ONE mint path: a single
///         `minter` address, which on mainnet is the OmertaBond contract.
///
///         ⚠ THIS DELETED THE SUITE'S OLDEST PROPERTY. Until tokenomics v2 step 4 this token had
///         no mint function at all, and "nothing mints" was the sentence every prior audit of this
///         suite leaned on. Founder ruling (omerta-tokenomics-v2-design.md §4): supply becomes
///         unbounded and BONDS ARE THE ONLY MINT. What replaces the fixed cap is not a promise but
///         FOUR walls, ALL of which live in OmertaBond and must all survive review:
///           1. `dailyCapOMR`  — a per-UTC-day ceiling on OMR issued. With no tranche to bound the
///                               total, this is now the blast radius of a leaked signer key, which
///                               makes it the single most load-bearing number in the system.
///           2. `MAX_DISCOUNT_BPS` (2000) — a discount is a mint at a price; an unbounded discount
///                               is a mint at any price.
///           3. `maxOmrPerEth`  — an ABSOLUTE mint-RATE ceiling, fail-closed at 0 (the GearVault cap
///                               precedent). The number a manipulated oracle cannot raise.
///           4. `oracle`        — the ACCRETION wall: a TWAP the signed quote's claimed market price
///                               must agree with, so the ceiling TRACKS the market instead of going
///                               stale. Also fail-closed. Composed with wall 3 it can only ever
///                               TIGHTEN what may be minted, never loosen it — read OmertaBond's
///                               header for why that asymmetry is what makes a price feed safe on a
///                               mint path at all.
///         This contract itself keeps exactly one rule, and it is the one that matters here: the
///         minter is a single address, set only by the owner, and every change is evented. There is
///         no owner mint, no mint-to-self, no second path.
///
///         THE DEX SELL TAX (founder-directed): transfers INTO a registered AMM pair
///         (a sell, or a non-exempt LP add) pay `sellTaxBps`, split FOUR ways — dev
///         (founder revenue), rwa (the treasury — a stock float until 2026-07-31), community
///         (the family buyback, treasury-to-family Phase 3) and lp (depth/buybacks) — IN THE
///         SAME TRANSFER, in lockstep with the backend's `SELL_TAX` constants so the two
///         layers can never disagree about where the money went. Everything else is clean:
///         buys (pair -> wallet), wallet -> wallet transfers, and every protocol flow
///         (VoucherClaim payouts, staking deposits, bond funding) move 1:1 — the
///         minimum possible honeypot-scanner surface for a sell-taxed token.
///
///         ONE VENUE, ONE LAYER (red-team C3). `OmertaHook` taxes the SAME kind of sale inside the v4
///         swap, and neither contract can see the other — so `MAX_SELL_TAX_BPS` is a ceiling on THIS
///         layer, and a seller pays the SUM of whatever is armed on the venue they traded. Registering
///         the v4 PoolManager as an `ammPairs` entry while the hook is armed therefore doubles the
///         rate past the ceiling both contracts advertise, and taxes protocol flows into the pool
///         (the POL-pairing bot's LP add) unless every one of them is `taxExempt`. The intended
///         configuration is the one CHAIN-DEPLOY states: the hook taxes the canonical pool, this path
///         stays armed at ZERO, and it is armed only for a venue the hook does NOT cover — which is
///         exactly what it exists for, since anyone may open an unhooked pool.
///
///         WHY FLAT (not age-based): every Uniswap trade routes through a router, so
///         the token only ever sees `router -> pool` — the real seller's identity and
///         holding time are invisible at the ERC-20 level. The 48h linearly-decaying
///         early-exit tax therefore lives at the GAME boundary (backend src/tax.js);
///         this flat on-chain layer stacks on top of it at the DEX.
///
///         GUARDRAILS (the anti-rug posture, for the auditor and token scanners):
///         - `MAX_SELL_TAX_BPS` (10%) is a compile-time hard cap — the owner can never
///           set a confiscatory rate.
///         - The tax defaults to 0 and applies only to pools the owner explicitly
///           registers; unregistered venues and plain transfers are never touched.
///         - Every knob emits an event; the Safe can renounce ownership to freeze the
///           configuration forever. Renouncing stays ONE step (Ownable2Step overrides only
///           `transferOwnership`, not `renounceOwnership`), so that escape hatch is intact;
///           HANDING ownership to a new address takes two (red team #8).
///
///         COMPOSABILITY (deploy-time requirement, see CHAIN-DEPLOY.md): a token that
///         taxes transfers into a pool is "fee-on-transfer" from that pool's view.
///         Uniswap V2-style pools support this (swaps must use the
///         *SupportingFeeOnTransferTokens router functions); Uniswap V3 does NOT —
///         canonical liquidity must live on a V2-compatible DEX (or a V4 hook pool).
