///
///         ── THERE IS NO ORACLE IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE HEADLINE ────────────────────────
///         The market is denomination-matched: USD debt against USD collateral. So a borrow
///         decision never reads a price, and **a price that is never read cannot be manipulated,
///         at any size, by anyone, ever.** That is FlashGuard's L0 and it is worth more than every
///         other guard here combined — both Inverse losses (~$21M) were exactly this class.
///
///         The consequence to state plainly: **there is no price at which a user is liquidated.**
///         There is no `liquidate()` in this contract. Debt only ever falls, from harvest or from
///         repayment. If a future market is cross-denominated it is a SEPARATE deployment with its
///         own oracle stack and its own audit — never a parameter change to this one.
///
///         ── NO POOL, THEREFORE NO SHARES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         Every depositor gets their own `CollateralEscrow`. The design's §5 sketch called for
///         shares accounting to fix Runtime Verification's finding #1 against Alchemix; escrows
///         make that finding UNREACHABLE instead, because the bug it describes only exists when a
///         pool must be divided. See CollateralEscrow's header for the full argument. Do not
///         reintroduce an internal share layer — it would re-create the bug it was meant to fix.

        // management fee that charges for the same money every harvest.

        // THE CLAMP BELOW IS REACHABLE, and the argument above is why it is easy to believe it is
        // not. `net` is computed with a floored fee, so net >= yield_(1-f) — it can sit up to one
        // unit ABOVE the exact figure, and dividing that back out by (1-f) can overshoot yield_ by
        // up to 1/(1-f). At DUST scale that rounds into a whole unit: yield_ = 4, f = 20% gives
        // net = 4, take = 4, naive fee = 1, take + fee = 5 > 4. Without the clamp the escrow would
        // be asked for more than it realised. It fires only in the last unit or two, which is
        // exactly why no test above the micro-unit range can see it — the fuzz's lower bound is
        // now 1 wei so it can, and test_the_dust_clamp_is_reachable pins the case by hand.
