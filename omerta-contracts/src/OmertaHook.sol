///         Same economics — dev / rwa / lp, same rates, same hard cap, same remainder rule — but
///         charged by a Uniswap v4 hook rather than by the token.
///
///         ── WHY THIS EXISTS (the flaw it fixes) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
///         The ERC-20 tax collects **OMR**, and every downstream consumer needs **ETH**. Paying the
///         founder, funding the treasury or deepening liquidity all require SELLING that OMR — and
///         each of those sales is itself sell pressure on the very pool being taxed. The tax was
///         reflexive: we taxed a sell, then sold to realise the tax. A v4 hook charges its fee
///         inside the swap and can charge it in EITHER currency, so pointing it at the quote side
///         makes the slices arrive as ETH already. The bracketed step disappears.
///
///         ── WHAT IS TAXED, EXACTLY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         A SELL (OMR in, quote out) — the swap-direction expression of the old `ammPairs[to]`
///         semantics. **BUYS ARE FREE**, as they are today.
///
///         The fee lands in `afterSwap`, on the UNSPECIFIED currency, which is what v4 lets a hook
///         take there. That has one consequence worth stating plainly rather than burying:
///
///           - **exact-input sell** (what every router and aggregator produces for a sell): the
///             unspecified currency is the OUTPUT, so the fee is taken in the QUOTE. This is the
///             upgrade, and it is where the volume is.
///           - **exact-output sell** (the swapper names the ETH they want): the unspecified currency
///             is the INPUT, so the fee is taken in OMR — at the same rate, on the actual input
///             consumed. That is EXACTLY what the ERC-20 tax does today, so this path is at parity
///             with the status quo rather than a regression, and it is not a bypass: it is taxed,
///             just in the worse currency. Both accrue and both sweep to the same four wallets.
///
///         `afterSwap` is deliberately the charging point rather than `beforeSwap`: it sees the
///         BalanceDelta the swap actually produced, so a partially-filled swap (one that hits a
///         price limit) is charged on what really moved. `beforeSwap` would overcharge it.
///
///         ── THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THE EVENT TRUSTWORTHY ────────────────────────────────────
///         A hook address is part of a PoolKey, so **anyone can create a pool that uses this hook**.
///         Without a gate, an attacker could stand up an (OMR, WORTHLESS) pool, swap against
///         themselves, and emit a real `SellTaxTaken` with a real transaction hash — fabricated
///         revenue wearing the one credential the backend's anti-fabrication gate trusts. So
///         `beforeInitialize` REVERTS unless one side is OMR and the other is a quote currency the
///         Safe has allowed. Every event this contract emits therefore describes a real OMR sell
///         into a real approved market, and every wei it accrues is an asset the Safe chose to hold.
///
///         ── WHAT AN IMMUTABLE HOOK MUST SHIP ON DAY ONE ──────────────────────────────────────
///         v4 encodes a hook's permissions in the low 14 bits of its ADDRESS. They cannot be
///         changed; adding a callback later means a new hook and a full liquidity migration. This
///         contract's logic is immutable too (no proxy — see the note on neutrality below), so the
///         same is true of any seam the roadmap needs. Hence two things that look unused today:
///           - `beforeSwap` / the fee-override return slot, so a dynamic-fee pool can use THIS hook
///             later. The rate ships FLAT (no override) — a fee curve is a new economic surface and
///             belongs in its own sign-off, not smuggled in with an infrastructure migration.
///           - `observer`, the oracle seam (§5). The oracle is step 3 and is its own contract with
///             its own audit surface; without this seam it could not be wired to this pool at all.
///
///         ── ANTI-RUG POSTURE, for the auditor and the token scanners ─────────────────────────
///         - `MAX_SELL_TAX_BPS` (1000 = 10%) is a COMPILE-TIME cap, mirroring `OMR.sol`. The Safe
///           can never set a confiscatory rate. It is a ceiling on THIS LAYER: `OMR.sol` taxes the
///           same sale from inside `_update` and the two contracts cannot see each other, so a seller
///           pays the SUM of whatever is armed on their venue (red-team C3). One venue, one layer —
///           this hook taxes the canonical pool and the token path stays at zero, which is also what
///           keeps the POL-pairing bot's LP add into this pool from being taxed on arrival.
///         - The remainder rule sits on the LP slice, so dev + rwa + community + lp == total EXACTLY
///           however the bps divide. Three of four round down; a "natural" last slice would strand
///           wei belonging to nobody. Same discipline as `OMR.sol`, `OmertaBond` and the backend's
///           ingest. The COMMUNITY slice (treasury-to-family Phase 3) funds the family buyback —
///           its recipient must be the community-buyback keeper wallet, a SEPARATE key from the
///           treasury's (the custody rule: booking family backing against ETH the family keeper
///           does not hold is the class `allocated <= held` exists to prevent).
///         - **There is no pause.** A hook that can revert `beforeSwap` can halt a public market,
///           and that is a power this contract deliberately does not take. The off switch is
///           `setSellTax(0, 0, 0, 0)`: the fee stops, the pool keeps trading.
///         - The fee ACCRUES here and is swept in a separate transaction. It is not pushed to four
///           external addresses mid-swap, because then any one of them reverting on receipt would
///           brick the pool. Pool liveness must not depend on a recipient's behaviour.
///         - `sweep` is permissionless and pays ONLY the Safe-set recipients. Nobody can redirect
///           it; the balance it holds is bounded by how often it is called.
///
///         ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         No age-based rate. `beforeSwap`/`afterSwap` receive the ROUTER as `sender`, not the
///         person, and the documented `IMsgSender(sender).msgSender()` recovery is a courtesy a
///         router may simply not implement — a wall that stops contributing precisely when someone
///         attacks it. The 48h early-exit decay stays at the game boundary (`src/tax.js`), where the
///         account's own ledger is authoritative and unfakeable.
///
///         Pool-local enforcement is the accepted cost (design §4): anyone may open an unhooked OMR
///         pool and trade untaxed. The defence is depth (protocol-owned liquidity), backed by
///         `OMR.sol`'s transfer tax retained ARMED AT ZERO as a universal backstop.
