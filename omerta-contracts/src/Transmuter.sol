/// @title Transmuter — 1:1 redemption, the buffer floor, and the only burn authority
/// @notice Design: `omerta-bank-protocol-design.md` §2.4, answering Runtime Verification's finding
///         #2 against Alchemix (the 1:1 promise must survive the backing losing value).
///
///         ── THE PROMISE, AND THE FOUR THINGS THAT KEEP IT ────────────────────────────────────
///         One DNR redeems for one dollar of underlying. Always, or the peg is a suggestion.
///           1. **Denomination matching** (§2.1) removes the price leg of RV's risk before it
///              starts — the collateral behind this token is the same unit as the debt.
///           2. **A hard buffer floor.** `bufferHealthy()` is false when reserves fall below
///              `BUFFER_FLOOR_BPS` of outstanding supply, and the Alchemist refuses to ISSUE while
///              it is false. **The protocol stops issuing before it stops paying** — that ordering
///              is the whole point and it is why the floor gates minting, not redemption.
///           3. **Flow limits** so one block cannot drain the queue.
///           4. The fuzzed supply-vs-collateral invariant, enforced in the Alchemist.
///
///         ── WHY REDEMPTION IS NOT SAME-BLOCK GUARDED, DELIBERATELY ───────────────────────────
///         `FlashGuard`'s L1 is absent from `redeem()` ON PURPOSE. Somebody who flash-loans to buy
///         DNR at 0.98 and redeems it here at 1.00 is REPAIRING OUR PEG at their own gas risk.
///         Blanket-blocking atomicity would disable the mechanism that keeps the peg honest — the
///         guards attach where atomicity creates an advantage, never where it creates a service.
///
///         Flow caps still apply, and they are a different tool: a cap bounds the SIZE of a drain
///         without forbidding the arbitrage. Do not "harden" this by adding `notSameBlockAsEntry`
///         to `redeem` — that would trade a live peg defense for a guard against nothing.
///
///         ── ACCOUNTING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         Reserves are tracked in a VARIABLE, never `asset.balanceOf(this)` (FlashGuard L7). A
///         direct token transfer to this contract is therefore ignored rather than credited, so a
///         donation cannot move the redemption rate or fake buffer health. Someone who wants to
///         strengthen the buffer calls `fund()`.
///
///         ── ⚠ DEPLOY REQUIREMENT: THE BUFFER MUST BE SEEDED, OR THE MARKET BRICKS ────────────
///         Found by this contract's own suite before any deployment, and it is not obvious:
///
///           • at zero supply `requiredBuffer()` is zero, but Alchemist validates again after mint;
///           • the instant supply would make the floor demand real backing, that mint rolls back;
///           • reserves are fed only by an explicit `fund()`, `repay()`, or `harvest()` transfer.
///
///         So an unseeded market refuses its first borrow before issuing any DNR. The launch sequence
///         must still be: `setFunder(safe, true)` → `fund(seed)` → arm the Alchemist.
///         `test_an_unseeded_market_refuses_the_first_borrow` pins that fail-closed behavior.
///
///         This is deliberately NOT fixed by exempting early borrows in code. An exemption is a
///         window in which the protocol issues claims it cannot honour, which is the exact
///         ordering §2.4 exists to forbid; requiring real backing up front is the honest version.
