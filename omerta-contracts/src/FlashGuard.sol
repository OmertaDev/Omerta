/// @title FlashGuard — atomicity defenses for THE BANK
/// @notice Founder-directed 2026-08-10: "figure out how to write in the smart contract ways to kill
///         flash loans from happening completely."
///
///         ── THE HONEST FRAMING, BECAUSE IT CHANGES WHAT TO BUILD ──────────────────────────────
///         A flash loan cannot be blocked. It is not a feature of any one lender; it is a property
///         of EVM atomicity — a transaction either fully succeeds or fully reverts, so anyone can
///         borrow inside one, and the source can be Aave, Balancer, Morpho, Uniswap, or a whale's
///         own balance. There is no switch.
///
///         There is also no need for one, because **a flash loan is never the vulnerability — it is
///         the amplifier.** Every flash-loan "exploit" on record is really one of three bugs:
///           (1) a price read from a source the caller can move inside the same transaction;
///           (2) a state you can ENTER and EXIT in one transaction and profit from the round trip
///               (same-block deposit→borrow, reward accrual, a governance snapshot);
///           (3) reentrancy.
///         The loan only makes the attacker briefly rich enough to do (1) or (2) at scale. Remove
///         those and a flash loan buys nothing — which is a far stronger position than trying to
///         detect and reject borrowed capital, a thing that cannot be reliably observed on-chain.
///
///         ── AND WE MUST NOT BLOCK ALL OF THEM ANYWAY ─────────────────────────────────────────
///         The Transmuter's 1:1 redemption is DEFENDED by arbitrage: someone who flash-loans to buy
///         DNR at 0.98 and redeem it at 1.00 is repairing our peg at their own gas risk. Blanket
///         "no flash loans" would disable the mechanism that keeps the peg honest. So the guards
///         here are SURGICAL — they attach to the paths where atomicity creates an advantage, and
///         deliberately not to the paths where it creates a service.
///
///         ── THE LAYERS, STRONGEST FIRST ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
///         L0  REMOVE THE TARGET. THE BANK's markets are denomination-matched (USD debt against USD
///             collateral, ETH against ETH — see the design's §2.1), so there is **no oracle on the
///             borrow path at all.** A price that is never read cannot be manipulated, at any size.
///             This is the FiRM lesson ("the best oracle is the one you removed") and it is worth
///             more than everything below combined. The two Inverse losses (~$21M) were both this.
///         L1  SAME-BLOCK SEPARATION  ← this contract. Enter and exit cannot share a block, so the
///             atomic round trip is impossible by construction.
///         L2  CONTRACT ALLOWLIST (not `tx.origin` — see the note on `onlyAllowedCaller`).
///         L3  TIME-WEIGHTED ACCRUAL — rewards/shares/voting accrue over elapsed time, so a
///             position held for zero blocks earns exactly zero. Implemented in the Alchemist.
///         L4  ORACLE HARDENING where an oracle genuinely is needed (the redemption price only):
///             Chainlink rather than a DEX TWAP, read pessimistically, with staleness and
///             single-block deviation circuit breakers.
///         L5  FLOW CAPS  ← this contract. Bounds the damage of everything above failing at once.
///         L6  REENTRANCY — `nonReentrant` plus strict checks-effects-interactions everywhere.
///         L7  SHARE-INFLATION / DONATION — track assets in a variable, never `balanceOf(this)`,
///             so a direct transfer cannot move the share price. (OZ 5.x ERC4626 virtual shares
///             cover the classic first-depositor case; internal accounting covers the rest.)
