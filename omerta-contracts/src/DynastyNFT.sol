/// @title DynastyNFT — OMERTÀ's identity NFT (omerta-dynasty-machine-design.md §4, omerta-identity-nft-design.md §5).
/// @notice The player's on-chain bloodline identity: the tradeable trophy an account mints. Deliberately
///         "the plainest possible ERC-721" — it holds no value, gates nothing, and carries no 6551 code.
///
///         NO STOCK IS DELIVERED HERE, and that is a decision rather than an omission (red-team C5).
///         An earlier cut of this header named this token as the host for the ERC-6551 account
///         `StockVault` pushes tokenized stock into; the shipped rail targets the STREET DEED's
///         token-bound account instead (`src/stockdeliver.js` — own the street, and the street holds
///         your legit book). Keeping stock OFF the identity token is what preserves the wall below: a
///         token that held real assets would be a bearer instrument, and its floor would become a
///         function of its contents rather than of the bloodline it commemorates.
///
///         THE WALL (identity §1, dynasty §2.2): the game ENTITLEMENT (`account_persistent.minted`, the
///         wage/withdraw gates) stays ACCOUNT-BOUND in the backend and is NEVER read off `balanceOf`. This
///         contract therefore gates NOTHING on a balance — the trophy transfers, the entitlement does not.
///         Selling this token sells the portrait and the record; it never sells the account, the login,
///         the legends, or the extraction entitlement.
///
///         SUPPLY IS UNCAPPED (founder rule 1: a cap on the identity would cap the player count). tokenId is
///         a plain sequential counter — a dynasty is not named at mint, and the backend maps tokenId → the
///         owning account off-chain. Minting is a SERVER-SIGNED voucher self-mint (the StreetDeed / OmertaBond
///         precedent): the player pays the ETH mint fee at `OmertaFees.payMintFee()` (the fee rail is
///         unchanged, wave-priced off-chain), the backend then signs a mint voucher, and the player claims
///         their trophy (paying their own gas). There is deliberately NO owner-mint, so "the Safe was
///         compromised" and "identities were minted" stay two separate events (the OMR.minter discipline).
///         A compromised signer is bounded by the daily mint cap (rate), the nonce (no replay), the short
///         deadline (+ a MAX_VOUCHER_TTL backstop), the Safe rotating the signer — and, decisively, that the
///         token carries NO extraction entitlement, so a signer minting trophies to itself steals nothing.
///
///         tokenURI is OFF-CHAIN (the layered portrait compositor), because the portrait is LIVE game history
///         that must resolve to the OWNING ACCOUNT'S CURRENT STREET — a thing the contract cannot know — and
///         it FREEZES at the first transfer away from the minting wallet (a sold portrait is a photograph;
///         the backend owns that semantics off the standard Transfer log + the `Minted` event's minter). No
///         mutable street name, no exact field-conjunction and no wealth is engraved on-chain (the
///         wallet↔character firewall + the anti-precise-kill-EV rule); provenance traits are an OPT-IN,
///         DISPLAY-ONLY off-chain metadata attribute and touch nothing here.
