/// @title OmertaBond — the disciplined treasury bond for Protocol-Owned Liquidity (design
///        omerta-reserve-bond-design.md; the OlympusDAO "Option C").
/// @notice A bonder deposits ETH → receives DISCOUNTED OMR, vested linearly; the ETH is split
///         (POL share + Vig share) and forwarded in the SAME tx, so this contract custodies no ETH.
///         ⚠ THIS CONTRACT MINTS (tokenomics v2 §4, founder ruling: "supply becomes unbounded;
///         bonds are the only mint"). Until step 4 it transferred from a Safe-funded tranche and
///         "nothing mints" was the property every prior audit of this suite rested on. That property
///         is GONE and FOUR walls replace it. All four must survive review; none is optional:
///
///           1. `dailyCapOMR` — OMR issuable per UTC day. The tranche used to bound the TOTAL a
///              leaked signer could extract; with no tranche, this bounds the DAY, and it is now the
///              single most load-bearing number in the system. Zero means unlimited, so a deploy that
///              forgets it is a deploy with no daily wall — set it.
///           2. `MAX_DISCOUNT_BPS` (2000, compile-time) — a discount is a mint at a price, and an
///              unbounded discount is a mint at any price.
///           3. `maxOmrPerEth` — an ABSOLUTE Safe-set ceiling on OMR minted per ETH, FAIL-CLOSED AT
///              ZERO (the GearVault gear-cap precedent): an unset ceiling means no bond can be struck
///              at all, so the failure mode of forgetting it is "the product is off", not "prints".
///           4. `oracle` — THE ACCRETION WALL (founder-directed, v2 §4). A TWAP that the signed
///              quote's claimed market price must agree with. Also fail-closed: unset, stale, zero,
///              or reverting each REVERT the bond.
///
///         WHY 3 AND 4 ARE BOTH HERE. This composition is the point, and deleting either half to
///         "simplify" removes the guarantee. Wall 3 alone is STATIC — it cannot track the market, so
///         it is either too loose (once OMR appreciates) or blocks honest bonds (once OMR falls).
///         Wall 4 alone puts a price feed on a MINT path, which is the classic route from an oracle
///         bug to unbounded supply. A bond must pass BOTH, so the real ceiling is:
///
///             effective rate ceiling = MIN( maxOmrPerEth , oracle x (1+tolerance) / (1-discount) )
///
///         **A MANIPULATED ORACLE CAN ONLY EVER TIGHTEN THIS, NEVER LOOSEN IT.** Push the oracle
///         down and bonding halts — a liveness problem, recoverable, no supply created. Push it up
///         and `maxOmrPerEth` still binds, because that is the Safe's number and no oracle can raise
///         it. That asymmetry is the entire reason a price feed is safe to put here.
///
///         ON "ACCRETIVE-ONLY", HONESTLY. Read literally — mint only when the ETH received is worth
///         at least the OMR issued — the rule forbids every DISCOUNTED bond, since a discount IS
///         issuing OMR worth more than the ETH paid; the literal rule and the product contradict
///         each other. What is implemented is that same inequality with two dials: the quote's
///         claimed price may not exceed the oracle by more than `priceToleranceBps`, and the discount
///         is capped by `MAX_DISCOUNT_BPS`. **Set both to zero and this becomes the literal rule
///         exactly** — so the literal case is a SETTING here, not something dropped. At non-zero
///         values it is a bounded, market-tracking dilution ceiling: the treasury always receives ETH
///         worth at least `(1-maxDiscount)/(1+tolerance)` of the OMR issued at market. Say that
///         number out loud when tuning these; do not call it accretion.
///
///         WHAT THE ORACLE STILL CANNOT SEE: true treasury BACKING (reserves / supply). This contract
///         custodies nothing — every wei is forwarded in the same transaction — so backing accretion
///         remains the job of the off-chain policy deciding what price to sign, where it can read the
