///
///         THE ONE STRUCTURAL RULE (design §0): the DEED transfers on-chain, the game's EXTRACTION
///         ENTITLEMENT and the rent/turf CONTROL do NOT. Provenance (the legend) travels with the
///         token — it is the value — and it is served off-chain because it is LIVE game history that
///         grows. Control is earned in-game; buying this token buys a collectible with a history, never
///         game power, so a liquid secondary market is safe (the v3-step-7 rarity-NFT posture: an
///         extracted item is INERT in-game). To play the rent/turf game with a deed again, its holder
///         RE-IMPORTS it (`redeem` → the burn is the proof; the backend re-creates the in-game deed).
///
///         Minting is by a SERVER-SIGNED voucher only — there is deliberately no owner-mint, so "the
///         Safe was compromised" and "deeds were minted" stay two separate events (the OMR.minter
///         discipline). A compromised signer is bounded by: the daily mint cap (rate), the nonce
///         (no replay), the short deadline (+ a MAX_VOUCHER_TTL backstop), the Safe rotating the
///         signer — and, decisively, that a deed carries NO extraction value (the `minted` flag does
///         not travel), so a signer that mints trophies to itself steals nothing a player can cash out.
///
///         tokenId = uint256(keccak256(bytes(name))). The server signs the canonical street NAME and
///         the contract DERIVES the tokenId, so the name↔tokenId map is a bijection enforced on-chain:
///         a voucher can never claim one tokenId for a different name, and a name can be minted at most
///         once (ERC-721 `_safeMint` reverts on an existing token). After a `redeem` burns it the token
///         no longer exists, so a fresh voucher (new nonce) can re-extract the SAME street — the id is
///         stable across round-trips because the name never changes.
