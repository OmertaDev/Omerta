# THE BROKERS — treasury-funded RWA rewards to NFT holders

Founder-directed 2026-08-10. Funding source: **the treasury slice** (founder decision). Denomination:
**tokenized stocks, in the Stonkbrokers pattern** (founder decision, made after the alternatives and
their costs were laid out).

> **Implementation amendment — 2026-08-24 (supersedes stale status and the gateless-keeper wording
> below).** Product copy and new code use Robinhood's required term **Stock Tokens**. The chosen
> activity policy is **minimum breadth/score, then uncapped proportional play**: at least 3 tracks and
> score 25, followed by the full linear score; agent-flag and NPC/resident accounts are excluded.
> `worker.js` now publishes the completed seven-day epoch automatically and `allocateEpoch` enforces
> both exclusions. Delivery still has no player claim, but it is no longer an unauthenticated keeper
> assertion once the Safe arms `StockVault.allocationSigner`: every push then requires an EIP-712
> authorization binding the frozen epoch hash, account hash, exact token, deed TBA, units, delivery id,
> and deadline. The EVM does not recompute gameplay; it verifies the independent server attestation.
>
> The acquisition authority is also explicit now. `StockTokenRegistry` is Safe-owned and enumerable;
> an isolated publisher may commit one closed-day family result, but only for an active registry entry.
> `RwaStockBuyer` accepts the immediately preceding UTC ballot day—not a ticker/address—resolves the
> exact token address snapshotted when that result was published, uses only a Safe-approved venue adapter,
> enforces a daily ETH cap and one buy per ballot, and verifies the exact resolved token arrived in
> `StockVault` above the stricter of an independent fresh-oracle floor
> and the keeper's floor. Both contracts deploy disabled via `DeployRwaStockMachine.s.sol`. The
> venue-specific adapter, quote/TWAP oracle, Safe catalog approvals, and mainnet funding remain launch
> configuration/gates; no document may
> describe those as live merely because the bounded contracts exist.
>
> **Founder compliance posture — 2026-08-24.** OMERTÀ performs no KYC, residency, sanctions, or other
> recipient-compliance check in gameplay or in the Stock Token delivery worker. Qualification is active
> play plus the linked-wallet/extracted-deed delivery target; issuer KYC at direct redemption is outside
> the game. The implementation already has this shape—there is no hidden eligibility-provider call to
> remove. This is a product/risk decision, not a claim of legal approval: Robinhood's permissionless ERC-20
> developer posture and its separately published transfer restrictions both remain facts the launch
> review must address. Adding a recipient gate later requires a new founder decision.

Supersedes nothing. It *reverses* part of `omerta-stock-layer-retirement.md` (2026-07-31), which is a
founder call and is recorded as such in §6.

## 1. The reference, accurately

StonkBrokers is a 4,444-item collection on Robinhood Chain — our chain — and the mechanism the
founder is pointing at is specific enough to copy properly rather than approximate:

- Each NFT is an **ERC-6551 token-bound account**: the NFT literally owns a wallet, seeded with
  tokenized stock (TSLA, AMZN) at mint.
- **Protocol fee income is converted into tokenized stock and dropped to those bound accounts.**
  Funding is cited as 70% of Anvil AMM transaction fees, triggered by a user "Clock In" action.
- Rewards are **not automatic for holders**. You must spend STONKBROKER tokens to *activate* the NFT
  into the distribution set. Five tiers, 66,666 → 1,666,666 tokens, weights 1× → ~3.33×.

Three things in that are worth taking, and one is worth *not* taking.

**Take:** the bound account (the reward has somewhere to live that travels with the NFT), the
activation burn (holding is not enough — you must commit to be paid, which is a token sink), and
fee-income-as-funding rather than a promise from treasury reserves.

**Do not take: activation weighting alone is WEALTH-weighted.** Their weight is a pure function of
how many tokens you burn, so the largest holder is by construction the largest earner, and the
mechanism rewards capital rather than participation. We already have the fix for that, built and
merged this week.

## 2. What we already have, and how well it fits

This is unusually well-matched to existing machinery. Almost nothing here is new invention:

| Stonkbrokers piece | Ours | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ERC-6551 bound account | The Dynasty NFT's token-bound account | **Designed, not built** (`omerta-identity-nft-design.md`) |
| Activation burn in the project token | A `$OMR` burn through the `spendOmr` till | Machinery exists; the sink is new |
| "Clock In" trigger | **`ACTIVITY`** — the metric merged in #29 | **Built** |
| Fee income as funding | The **treasury slice** — 10% of gameplay fees, 25% of bonds, 20% of Store, 4% of the sell tax, accruing in `rwa_revenue` | **Built** |
| `allocated ≤ held` | `runTreasuryInvariants` | **Built** — ETH arm *and* per-ticker units (step 2, done) |

**The ACTIVITY fit is the important one.** Their "Clock In" is a button; ours is a measured,
Sybil-resistant, fail-closed score over throttled actions with a breadth gate and agent exclusion.
Using it as the second weighting term turns a wealth-weighted airdrop into a **play-weighted** one,
which is both a better game and a materially better posture on every other axis.

## 3. The architecture

```
Robinhood /rhj/assets ──proposal──▶ OMERTÀ Safe ──approval──▶ StockTokenRegistry (chain 4663)
                                                               │ active candidates

                                                               ▼
treasury ETH ──keeper──▶ RwaStockBuyer ──approved adapter──▶ StockVault (exact-token balance check)
                                                                  │
completed activity epoch ─▶ weight snapshot ─▶ allocations ─▶ signed delivery authorization
                                                                  ▼
                                                   Street Deed ERC-6551 account
```

The server mirrors the on-chain active registry into Postgres before ballot resolution. Voting never
waits on RPC under a family/character lock, and an RPC outage preserves the last-known-good approved
list. The pre-chain development fallback publishes the original launch allowlist with null addresses;
it is not purchase authority. In production, an empty synced registry means no candidates—not an
automatic fall-through to static tickers.

**Operator intake (implemented 2026-08-24, bootstrap policy approved 2026-08-24).**
`npm run stock-catalog` reads Robinhood's official `https://api.robinhood.com/rhj/assets` discovery
endpoint and reports the chain-4663 deployments, provider asset IDs, status, decimals, and trading
capabilities. `--initial-top-volume --registry <address>` also reads the official bulk `/rhj/prices`
feed and automatically emits the one-time initial Safe proposal for exactly the top 15 eligible assets
by `dailyTradingVolume`. That field is the underlying security's daily share volume—not on-chain DEX
volume or mint/burn volume. Eligibility requires active + fractional-tradable metadata, canonical
address agreement between both feeds, a fresh non-halted quote, and positive bid/ask/volume; exact
decimal comparison and ticker-order tie breaking make the output deterministic. The registry's ranked
insertion order becomes the production fallback order, so silence/ties select the highest-volume active
entry rather than an arbitrary alphabetic ticker. The static SPY default is development-only once a
production registry is configured.

The tool never signs or sends a privileged write. The Safe still verifies legal/product eligibility,
the supported venue route and independent oracle, and exposure caps before executing the generated
calls. This is an initial snapshot, not an automatically rotating index: supplying `--tickers` plus
`--registry` emits unsigned calldata for later explicitly reviewed changes, and a newly listed provider
asset never auto-enrolls. `--deactivate SYMBOL` produces the corresponding unsigned Safe removal call. Once the
Safe executes the calls, the hourly registry mirror makes the subset visible
through `GET /v1/commission/ticker`; that public response is the single candidate feed for the Family
screen and API clients.

**Epochs, not streams.** Allocation runs once per epoch (weekly) over a snapshot, because a
continuously-streamed balance is far harder to reason about, to audit, and to stop. An epoch that has
not run yet can be cancelled; a stream cannot.

### 3.1 The weight, which is the whole design

```
weight(nft) = activationMult(tier) × activityScore(owner, epoch)
```

- `activationMult` — the Stonkbrokers half. A tiered `$OMR` burn, weights 1× → ~3×. **A sink**, which
  the late-game economy wants anyway.
- `activityScore` — the half they do not have. Linear in effort, capped per account only by the
  breadth **gate** (never a cap — a cap is Sybil-*positive*, see the #29 reasoning), agents and NPC
  residents excluded at source.
- **A zero on either term is a zero.** An unactivated NFT earns nothing; an activated NFT owned by
  somebody who did not play earns nothing. That second one is the sentence that makes this a game
  mechanic rather than a yield product, and it should not be softened later.

### 3.2 The walls

1. **`allocated ≤ held`, PER TICKER, in units.** The game may only ever owe stock it already holds.
   This is the wall the retirement removed by holding ETH; buying stock again brings it back, and it
   must be re-denominated in units per ticker — a cash-value version silently permits owing more
   units than exist when a price moves.
2. **Never by chance.** Both weight terms are deterministic. No RNG anywhere in acquisition,
   allocation, or delivery. This is a standing project rule and it is what keeps the mechanism out of
   loot-box territory entirely.
3. **The keeper is fail-closed and TWAP-bounded** — the `OmrTwapOracle` / bond-dial discipline: a
   stale or absent price halts buying rather than defaulting to a number, and a per-buy price
   continuity bound (a generous multiple of the last print) makes a fat-finger or a leaked key unable
   to buy at an absurd rate. Anything else is a free option on the treasury.
4. **The treasury cannot be spent past what arrived.** `ethToSpend ≤ received − alreadySpent`, the
   `runVigBuyback` root cap, applied to the treasury ledger.
5. **Comps book zero.** A mod/QA path may exercise the mechanism but must record no revenue and no
   holdings — the anti-fabrication gate that already guards the Vig, the Store, bonds and the desk.
   Fabricated backing is invisible to precisely the check that is supposed to catch it.

### 3.2b DECIDED (founder, 2026-08-15) — play-weighted distribution stands; burn-to-redeem is REJECTED

The founder asked whether a simpler **burn-to-redeem** counter (burn X $OMR → X-worth of stock at an
oracle price) would beat the built play-weighted distribution, and chose to **keep the distribution**
after the trade was laid out. Recorded here so the fork is not re-litigated — this is the THIRD time
the same underlying call has been made (the stock-layer retirement rejected stock-denominated claims;
the 2026-08-10 brokers directive chose play-weighted rewards; this confirms both against the sharper
alternative). The four costs of burn-to-redeem, for the record: **(1)** a quoted price + consideration
+ a specific security delivered on demand is the shape of operating a DEALER — the sharp form of the
launch-checklist row the activation leg already carries in soft form, and a redemption counter anyone
holding $OMR can draw on surrenders the delivery control the issuer restriction requires; **(2)** it
puts an ORACLE on the player path — every lag is a free option against the treasury (the retired RWA
float's #1 flagged economics item), and it breaks the same-asset-both-sides wall that made the ETH
vault safe (owing stock priced through two markets while holding it through one), where the built
distribution has NO price on the player side at all and is structurally immune to price manipulation;
**(3)** a redemption board publishes a value-per-$OMR figure, which the standing copy rule forbids and
which changes what the TOKEN is, not just the stock rail; **(4)** it is a shop, not a loop — one-shot
wealth-shaped demand, where activation is recurring and gated on PLAY (an activated idler earns
nothing, the design's own anti-yield-product assertion). The legibility burn-to-redeem would have
bought is answered elsewhere: **the ETH vault IS the burn-to-redeem rail**, live today, in the one
asset where same-asset-both-sides holds — the two rails coexist and serve different roles. The
residual cost of the distribution (it is harder to explain than a redemption counter) is a
client/copy problem, not a mechanism problem.

### 3.3 DECIDED — stock lands in the bound account, and there is no claim gate

**Founder decision, 2026-08-10, taken after the alternatives and their costs were put in front of
them twice.** Stock accrues STRAIGHT into the NFT's ERC-6551 account, Stonkbrokers-style, and there
is no gate at delivery.

The case for it is real and was not a close call on product grounds: it is the proven model, the NFT
visibly *contains* value, delivery is atomic and trustless with no claim process, nothing sits
unclaimed in a protocol contract, and the NFT sells self-contained.

**What was argued against it and rejected — recorded so the tradeoff is not rediscovered later as a
surprise:**

1. **The NFT becomes a bearer instrument for real assets.** Any marketplace buyer acquires the stock
   with no identity verification, no eligibility gate and no check on who they are. Against the one hard operational fact here —
   Robinhood's tokenized stocks are EU-facing and restricted by the issuer — this routes them to US
   persons by default, with no off switch.
2. **It is the irreversible direction.** Claim-then-deliver could always have become bearer later;
   bearer cannot become gated, because once stock is in freely-trading TBAs it is gone. That
   asymmetry was the recommendation's whole basis.
3. **It contradicts our own entitlement wall.** `omerta-identity-nft-design.md` states *"the token is
   a tradeable trophy; the game entitlement is account-bound and never read off a balance."* That rule
   does not survive this decision, and that doc should be amended rather than left contradicting
   reality.
4. **The floor becomes a function of contents rather than utility** — the cheap end of the order book
   becomes drained NFTs and contents-vs-floor arbitrage, the same dynamic the identity-NFT design
   already flagged for the entitlement.

**The consequence that changes what gets built, and the reason it is written here rather than only in
a commit message:** with no claim gate, **`allocated <= held` is the only wall left** between the
treasury and a bad delivery. It stops being one check among several and becomes load-bearing, so it is
built FIRST, in per-ticker UNITS (a cash-value version silently permits owing more units than exist
the moment a price moves), and watched nightly by `alertDrift` rather than merely asserted in a test.

### 3.4 AMENDED — stock lands in the STREET DEED, not the identity NFT (founder-directed 2026-08-14)

§3.3 chose the ERC-6551 bound account of the **Dynasty (identity) NFT** as the container. The founder
redirected delivery to the **Street Deed** NFT: the treasury-bought tokenized stock is delivered into
the player's on-chain Street Deed's ERC-6551 token-bound account. The deed becomes a self-contained
real-estate-plus-portfolio NFT — *own the street, and the street holds your legit book; sell the
street, sell the book with it.*

**Why the deed is the better container (the redirect is a strict improvement, not a lateral move):**

1. **It fits the fiction exactly.** The mob's legit front is real estate; the deed IS the real estate.
   Stock sitting under a deed reads as "the family's holdings on that street," where stock in an
   identity PFP read as nothing in particular.
2. **The deed already IS a tradeable, self-contained asset** (Phase 3 secondary market + the
   extract/re-import lifecycle). A deed that also contains a stock portfolio is a stronger
   secondary-market object than an identity PFP; §3.3's "the NFT sells self-contained" argument lands
   harder on an NFT that was already built to be sold.
3. **The identity NFT's entitlement wall SURVIVES.** §3.3 argument 3 said the container decision
   *"does not survive"* the identity-NFT rule that "the token is a tradeable trophy; the game
   entitlement is account-bound and never read off a balance" — because stock in the identity NFT
   makes it a bearer instrument. Moving the stock to the deed removes that contradiction: the Dynasty
   NFT holds no stock, so `balanceOf` still gates nothing and the entitlement stays account-bound.
   The identity-NFT design's wall is now intact rather than amended. (`DynastyNFT.sol` already gates
   nothing on `balanceOf` — this keeps it that way.)

**The rule that follows, and the utility it creates.** A Street Deed is an on-chain ERC-721 only once
EXTRACTED (`street_deeds.onchain_token_id` non-null). So: **to RECEIVE delivered tokenized stock
on-chain, a player must own and EXTRACT a Street Deed.** An account with no deed, or an un-extracted
one, accrues its `stock_allocations` as owed and waits — nothing is lost, delivery just has no target
yet. **Founder-resolved 2026-08-24: that pending debt is permanent.** It has no expiry, inactivity
forfeiture, treasury clawback, or redistribution into a later epoch; it remains owed until the account
again has a valid extracted-deed target. This gives the deed a powerful new reason to exist (claim a
street, extract it, and it becomes your investment vault) without changing any of the wall math.

**§3.3's accepted risks (1 and 4) still apply, now on the deed, and are RE-flagged here rather than
re-discovered later:**
- **Bearer instrument (arg 1).** A deed's marketplace buyer acquires the stock inside it with no
  on-chain eligibility check — the same accepted, legal-cleared risk, now on an NFT already built to
  trade. Unchanged in kind.
- **Floor-as-contents (arg 4).** A deed's secondary price now partly reflects the stock in its TBA;
  the cheap end of the deed order book becomes drained deeds. Same dynamic §3.3 accepted.
- **Drain-before-sale.** The canonical ERC-6551 account lets the NFT owner control the TBA, so a
  seller CAN drain the stock before selling the deed. This is inherent to gateless push into any
  tradeable NFT's TBA (`omerta-identity-nft-design.md` flags the mitigations — a listing lock, or a
  voucher-gated TBA outflow — as launch-review items). On-chain, `StreetDeed.transferLocked` is the
  most any rule can do: it forces the drain BEFORE the unlock, so an unlock is the public "check the
  vault now" moment. Off-chain, the answer is disclosure — see §3.4a.

### 3.4a The vault survives the burn — and the IN-GAME market had to be told (2026-08-16)

`tokenId = keccak256(bytes(name))`, so a deed's ERC-6551 account is a function of its NAME. Burn the
NFT (`redeem`) and re-import the street, sell it **in-game**, and the buyer's next extraction resolves
the SAME vault — whatever sits in it travels with the name, while the in-game deed market priced the
street with no sight of it. The on-chain half has a listing lock; **a database row is not an ERC-721
transfer**, so nothing on that path warned anybody.

**Three fixes were ruled out before the fourth was built, and the reasons matter more than the fix:**

1. *Make the tokenId unique per extraction so the vault does not follow the name.* Worse than the gap:
   the bijection is load-bearing precisely BECAUSE it makes a burned deed's vault **recoverable**.
   Break it and every re-import orphans real stock at an address nobody can ever reach again.
2. *Refuse the re-import.* Not available — `applyDeedReimport` runs off the `Redeemed` watcher, and by
   then the burn has already happened on-chain. Refusing strands the deed in-game as well.
3. *Show a live balance on the market board.* `/v1/deeds` is polled; one RPC per listing per render is
   the shape the poll-cost pass spent a session removing.

**What shipped is DISCLOSURE** (the terms ride with the price — the pad, the nut, the Port lane):
- The **record** (`vaultHistoryFor`) on the deed card and every market listing — a pure DB read of
  `stock_deliveries`, so it costs nothing and works chain-dormant.
- Phrased **RECEIVED, never "holds"**. The game knows what was pushed IN; the owner controls the
  account and can move tokens out. A delivered total presented as a balance is a false claim on a
  purchase screen, which is strictly worse than silence. Comps are excluded (`tx_hash IS NOT NULL`) —
  counting one would fabricate exactly what that gate exists to prevent.
- The **live balance at the buy-CONFIRM step** (`vaultLiveBalances`), one RPC at the moment the money
  moves, run OUTSIDE the read transaction (an RPC inside a held txn pins a pooled connection — the
  `bankPosition` posture). Chain-dormant → the buyer is told the live figure is unavailable, never
  shown a fabricated zero: "we can't see the vault" and "the vault is empty" are different answers.
- A **warning before the burn** on the client's re-import copy: burning brings the street home, it does
  not empty the vault; move what's yours out first.

**What this changes in the build (and what it does NOT):** the `allocated ≤ held` wall (per ticker, in
units) is UNCHANGED — the delivery TARGET moving from the Dynasty TBA to the Deed TBA does not touch
what may be owed or how it is bounded. The only new surface is the DELIVERY rail (`src/stockdeliver.js`):
resolve each owed allocation to the account's extracted-deed ERC-6551 TBA and drive `StockVault.deliver`
there, idempotently, with a new `delivered ≤ allocated` nightly check so a delivery can never exceed
what was allocated. Because the `Delivered` event carries only a `deliveryId`, the rail is two-phase —
STAGE records what the keeper is about to send (deterministic `deliveryId` = keccak of
`stockdeliver:<epoch>:<account>:<TICKER>`, so a re-drive maps to the same on-chain id), and only the
`Delivered` watcher CONFIRMS it and flips the `stock_allocations.delivered` flag (a comp/simulated
stage is never confirmed — the treasury.js `txHash` gate). Built chain-dormant (the established
discipline — the day the market deploys, the rail exists), §10.4-NEUTRAL by construction (out-of-band
real value — zero `transactions` rows). One subtlety the build turns on: `chain.js:markDeedExtracted`
re-keys the extracted deed's `account_id` to `onchain:<tokenId>`, severing the account→deed link, so
the re-key also stamps `extracted_by_account` — which is what the delivery rail JOINs on to find an
account's on-chain deed.

**The same bijection is what makes an accidental burn RECOVERABLE (2026-08-16).** Because the id is
`keccak(NAME)` and nothing ever deletes a `street_deeds` row or frees its unique name, a burn FREEZES
the vault rather than emptying it — re-minting that street restores control with the contents intact.
In the ordinary case nobody acts: the re-import stays `pending` and the worker sweep retries forever.
The one case that never resolves is a burn from a wallet that will never link, and it needs no
contract change — `POST /v1/mod/deeds/recover {street}` signs a `DeedVoucher` for that street to the
TREASURY HOLDING address (`DEED_RECOVERY_ADDRESS`), bounded by four walls: a fixed destination (never
caller-supplied), a recorded burn still in the on-chain state (so it can never be a confiscation — the
contract backstops it, since `_safeMint` reverts on a live id), a 30-day wait that distinguishes
stranded from in-flight, and superseding the pending re-import so the sweep cannot later hand the
street to the burner while the treasury holds the NFT. Runbook in CHAIN-DEPLOY §8.

**Deferred, flagged (not built):** the drain-before-sale mitigation beyond the listing lock + the
disclosure in §3.4a — a voucher-gated TBA outflow is the only stronger form, and it costs the
"self-contained NFT" property the gateless push was chosen for. (The other two former deferrals are
CLOSED: the deed `Transfer` watcher re-targets delivery to a SECONDARY owner, and
`runStockDeliveryKeeper` is the real TX send.)

---

## 4. What this does NOT touch

The founder's funding decision keeps every existing wall intact, and that is worth stating plainly:

- **Withdrawals are unaffected.** The Vig still funds the reserve; `extraction ≤ inflow` holds exactly
  as before. This was the alternative that would have broken it, and it was not chosen.
- **§10.4 is unaffected.** Treasury ETH and tokenized stock are out-of-band real value; they write no
  `transactions` rows, exactly like `fees.js`. The activation burn IS in-game and rides the existing
  `$OMR` sink vocabulary.
- **No new emission.** Nothing here mints `$OMR`; the activation tier only burns it.

---

## 5. Order of work

1. **The gate, before code.** §6.
2. ~~Re-denominate `runTreasuryInvariants` to per-ticker units and restore the `allocated ≤ held`
   wall.~~ **DONE.**
3. ~~The activation tiers + burn (in-game, shippable independently, a pure `$OMR` sink).~~ **DONE.**
4. ~~The epoch allocator, computing weights off `ACTIVITY` — off-chain, dormant, no delivery.~~
   **DONE.**
5. ~~The buy keeper — chain-dormant behind the standing gates.~~ **DONE** (`runStockBuyback`,
   `POST /v1/mod/treasury/keeper`). It reads `stockBudget()` for its root cap (wall 4) and writes
   through `recordStockBuy`, so wall 5 (comps book zero) and idempotency are inherited rather than
   reimplemented. **Wall 3 was its job and deliberately not step 2's:** `recordStockBuy` ingests a
   fill that already happened on-chain, and refusing to record a real fill would make the books
   disagree with the chain rather than prevent anything (the `recordBond` lesson).
   **The multiple is now sized** — `npm run keeper-dials`, recorded in BALANCE.md § THE KEEPER'S
   WALLS: **2× the last real print, 0.2× floor, halt past a 30d-old print, refuse a first buy.** The
   sizing produced a finding worth carrying into step 7: the multiple does NOT bound the damage
   (wall 4 does), and buying few units for much ETH leaves `allocated ≤ held` perfectly true — so
   this is a wall precisely because no check can see it. The first cut scaled the bound with the gap
   and had to be discarded: it reaches 26× at a quarter, and a bound that widens with staleness is
   not fail-closed.
6. The Dynasty NFT + ERC-6551 bound accounts. **The OFF-CHAIN half is DONE** — `src/portrait.js`,
   `test/portrait.js`, `GET /v1/identity/:characterId/portrait.svg` and the ERC-721-shaped metadata
   at `GET /v1/identity/:characterId`, pointing at no token. That is `omerta-identity-nft-design.md`
   §5's phase 1 + phase 2, which that doc sequences first *because they carry no gate at all* and
   because the portrait is the thing the token would point at, so the ordering costs nothing.
   **The CONTRACT half is correctly still waiting**, on two independent gates: an OPEN
   launch-checklist row (the dynasty design's §7.2 makes the contract conditional on two of them; one
   is cleared, the other re-opened when the published tranche schedule changed what it covers), and the
   third-party audit batch — which the dynasty design says to **batch, not dribble**, so writing
   `DynastyNFT` now would start that clock for one contract instead of the set.
   The build corrected three of the design's own slots; the reasons are recorded in the identity
   doc's §3 banner, and one of them was a defect that doc had already flagged and nobody had acted
   on: the frame slot cited **`dynastyTierOf`, which no longer exists** (retired with the Portfolio at
   D11). The suite now asserts it is gone, so the frame cannot be re-sourced back to a dead symbol.
7. Delivery. **Last**, and only after 1.

Steps 2–5 are done, and step 6's off-chain half with them. **THE DISTRIBUTION landed 2026-08-15**
(`brokers.js:distributeBuy`, `POST /v1/mod/treasury/distribute`) — the link steps 4 and 5 left
implicit: a REAL buy's units split pro-rata over an epoch's published weights into
`stock_allocations`, exactly once (a `distributed` latch on the buy row), every share written
through the audited `allocateStock` clamp. Two rules are load-bearing: **the frozen-weights rule**
(a buy distributes only to the latest epoch published BEFORE it — the allocator reads LIVE
activations at publish time, so a post-buy epoch could include someone who activated after seeing
the buy land, the retroactive windfall §8's no-roll-forward rule forbids; ops order is publish →
buy → distribute) and **the silent-epoch rule** (a buy with no frozen epoch, or a weightless one,
CONSUMES its latch with zero allocations — the units sit unallocated in held forever, never
tomorrow's jackpot). Dormant by construction pre-mainnet: only a real buy's units exist to split,
and comps book zero. What remains is step 6's CONTRACT half of the on-chain batch — **now written**
(`DynastyNFT.sol`, 2026-08-14, in the audit batch) — and delivery (step 7), whose backend
(`src/stockdeliver.js`: plan/stage/keeper/watcher) is also built and chain-dormant; the chain from
activation burn to a share landing in a Street Deed's TBA is code-complete end to end, gated only
on the audit + the launch review. The portrait is the clearest case for that ordering: it is the
whole player-visible half of the flagship asset, and it shipped without touching a gate.

### 5.1 What step 2 actually built, and the one thing it found

The wall is back in `src/treasury.js`, in two arms, both inside `runTreasuryInvariants` — which was
*already* wired into the worker's nightly `alertDrift`, so the new checks inherited the alarm the
moment they existed rather than needing their own.

- **`allocated ≤ held (<TICKER>, units)`, one check per ticker.** Not a summed one: stocks are not
  fungible and a delivery is made in a *specific* ticker, so a summed check would let the treasury owe
  TSLA it does not hold as long as it held enough AMZN.
- **`allocateStock` is the only writer of the owed side, and it clamps.** The invariant is the
  *detector*; the clamp is the *prevention*, and with §3.3's no-gate delivery a detector that fires
  the next night is too late — the units are already in a freely-trading bound account. The clamp
  reads-then-writes, so it is only as good as its serialization: verified against **real Postgres**
  by racing two allocations of 8 against a reserve of 10 — they came back **8 + 2**, not 8 + 8. The
  suite cannot show that (pg-mem is single-caller, so it exercises the arithmetic and Postgres
  exercises the lock), which is the same split the ETH pool lock already lives under.
- **A comp books ZERO units.** The `txHash` gate matters more here than anywhere else it appears:
  everywhere else a comp merely fails to credit revenue, but here the fabricated quantity *is the
  wall's input*, so a QA fill that booked units would raise the delivery ceiling with no asset behind
  it — invisible to precisely the check meant to catch it.

**The thing it found, which was not in the plan.** `rwa_revenue` is an *inflow* ledger: it records
what arrived and nothing about what leaves. So the moment the keeper converts treasury ETH into
stock, the Safe holds less ETH and **no existing number moves**. The ETH vault would have gone on
quoting availability out of ETH that was already spent, allocating it to players, with
`allocated ≤ held` reading green throughout. The ETH arm is therefore
`allocated + spent ≤ held (ETH)` — the spend term inside the comparison, not beside it — and
`stockBudget()` exposes the same figure as the keeper's root cap, so ETH already promised to a
player's vault line is not the keeper's to spend. Reopening the stock layer would have quietly
weakened the wall the retirement was written to strengthen.

**Two things the existing guards caught, both worth recording.** The first cut *replaced* the ETH
check with the spend-aware one, and two suites that look it up by name went red. Renaming them would
have been the cheap fix; emitting **both** is the better one, because the two ways the ETH arm can
break have different owners — `allocated ≤ held` breaching is a claim-path bug in the vault, while
`allocated + spent ≤ held` breaching *while the first holds* is an overspending keeper. One check
catches both and tells whoever is woken by the alarm nothing about which they are looking at.

The second was a `test/tokenomics.js` assertion reading `holds === 'eth'` with the words *"it does
not buy stock"* — a statement of fact from the retirement that this design reverses. A test pinning a
reversed decision protects nothing, so the fact was updated rather than defended; what was kept is
the part that still holds and still matters, which is that **the player-facing vault rail stays
denominated in ETH alone**. The treasury holding stock for this distribution never puts a player's
claim into an asset the game would have to cash-settle — that separation was the retirement's central
point and it survives intact.

## 6. What this reverses, and what the gate is for

The founder cleared this to be built (this session, and the standing directive in `CLAUDE.md`). This
section exists because the next reader needs the facts in one place.

**What is being reversed.** `omerta-stock-layer-retirement.md` retired stock acquisition on
2026-07-31 with recorded reasons: it deleted the project's one gated surface, removed the
verification and eligibility requirements, and stopped R2/R3 being carried milestones. This design
reopens all three.

**What a precedent does and does not establish.** StonkBrokers is doing this, visibly, at scale, on
the same chain. That is real evidence about what infrastructure exists and how it is received. **It
is not a clearance, and "they did it first" has never been a defence.** Worth saying plainly once so
nobody mistakes a citation for a green light.

**Three concrete facts that do not go away:**

1. **Handing an asset to somebody because they hold the token is the sharpest surface in the
   project**, and a launch-checklist row already covers it. Weighting by *play* rather than by
   holdings genuinely helps — effort is not passive — and the activation burn is a purchase rather
   than a payout. Neither makes the question go away.
2. **Eligibility is an operational constraint.** Robinhood's tokenized stocks are EU-facing and not
   offered everywhere, so delivery realistically needs an eligibility gate and identity verification
   at the boundary — which is exactly the machinery the retirement deleted.
3. **A bearer-instrument NFT (§3.3) is the sharpest version of all of the above**, because the asset
   then moves on a secondary marketplace with no gate at all.

**The recommendation, made once:** get the §3.3 fork and the delivery boundary onto the launch
checklist *before* step 7, not after. Everything in steps 2–6 can be built, tested and merged
meanwhile without a single share changing hands, which is why the order of work is arranged that way.
