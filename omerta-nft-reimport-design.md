# NFT re-import — reactivating an extracted item for in-game use (Option A)

**Status: BUILT off-chain + on-chain contract, CHAIN-DORMANT (founder-directed — "Option A for this"
2026-08-13; built 2026-08-14). A DELIBERATE PIVOT, not a bug fix.** The mechanism is complete: the
GearVault `redeem` burn path (contract + forge tests), the JS `nftDecode`, the `Redeemed` watcher, the
`reimportItem`/`sweepReimports` backend, and `test/reimport.js`. It rides behind the same chain gates as
the rest of the on-chain items rail (`omerta-onchain-items-design.md`) — **dormant in production** (no
`GEARVAULT_ADDRESS`, no live chain) — and the contract change (the burn path) resets the third-party-audit
clock, so it goes into that audit batch before mainnet, never a hot-fix.

**WHAT WAS BUILT vs the sketch below.** The scope was CARS and BOATS (the instance-row classes this design
foregrounds). **Gear is deliberately one-way** — the contract's `redeem` rejects a gear token — because
gear's in-game form is account-level SET MEMBERSHIP (`account_gear`), the same reason `character_assets`
are deferred (§1); rejecting it at the contract means a player can never burn a gear NFT expecting a
re-import that will not happen. The cap accounting (§2/§4) landed as a `redeemed[tokenId]` counter so the
bound is on LIVE on-chain supply (`minted - redeemed <= cap`) rather than lifetime mints — see §2. The
re-import CREATES a fresh row keyed to the burner (never un-flags an existing one — §1). Over-cap is
allowed (the market-win precedent) rather than refused, so a burned NFT is never stranded — see §3.

## 0. What this changes, stated first so it can't be missed

Today an extracted item is **inert**: safe (survives death, can't be stolen or won off you) but
useless in-game (never races, hauls, boosts, fences or melts). That rule is the single thing that
makes a liquid secondary market *safe* — a buyer on OpenSea gets a **trophy, not game power**, so
marketplace demand cannot pull earned power out of the game (`omerta-onchain-items-design.md` §5).

**Option A deletes that safety property on purpose.** Re-import lets the current on-chain owner deposit
the NFT back into the game and use it as a real car/boat/gear. The direct consequence, which the
founder is choosing knowingly:

> **The marketplace becomes a pay-for-power channel.** A player can buy a rare or maxed car on
> OpenSea, re-import it, and hold game power they did not earn. The item's real cost stops being the
> mint/extract price and becomes its **secondary-market floor** — for an item WITH game power, which
> the inert rule existed to forbid.

This is a legitimate design choice (many games make it), but it is a PIVOT away from OMERTÀ's
otherwise anti-pay-to-win posture and away from the sim-audited assumption that rare items are earned.
It must be recorded as such — in BALANCE.md, in the player-facing copy, and in the marketing (a game
where marketplace items convey power is a materially different product to describe than one where they
are cosmetic). The standing no-earnings-promise / no-appreciation-language rules apply with MORE force,
because now a purchasable asset genuinely affects play.

**The half of the rule that STAYS:** an item is still inert *while it is on-chain*. Listing it, holding
it, selling it — all inert. Only the deliberate re-import flips it back to live. So "buy power" is
always a two-step act the buyer chooses (own the NFT → re-import), never a passive property of holding.

## 1. The mechanism

Extraction (already built) is: in-game car row → `mint` the ERC-1155 (GearVault), set
`characters.…minted_onchain=true`, and `loadOwned` filters it out of `owned.cars` so nothing in-game
may touch it (`game.js:371`, `nft.js:100`). Re-import is the exact inverse:

1. **The owner links their wallet** (SIWE — already built). The depositing wallet must resolve to an
   OMERTÀ account with a **living character** to attach the item to (else the re-import waits / is
   rejected with a clear reason — you can't put a car in a dead man's garage).
2. **The owner deposits the NFT to the vault** — an on-chain transaction THEY sign, which is the
   ownership proof. This calls a NEW GearVault path (see §2): the token is **burned or locked**, and a
   `Redeemed(owner, tokenId, amount)` event is emitted.
3. **The watcher** (the polled `getLogs` sync, already built for `Claimed`) sees `Redeemed` after
   `CHAIN_CONFIRMATIONS`, decodes the tokenId (`kind : catalogId : rarity` — the metadata rail already
   derives all three, so the decode half is DONE), and **re-creates the in-game row** on the linked
   account's living character: a car/boat of the exact catalog class and rarity, `minted_onchain=false`,
   live again in `owned.cars`.
4. **The token is gone** (burned) — so the item can never exist on-chain (tradeable) AND in-game
   (usable) at once. That airtight consumption is the entire safety of the feature.

Same flow for boats and gear (the tokenId space already separates them). Assets (`character_assets`,
set-membership with no instance) stay deferred, as the items doc noted.

## 2. The one contract change — a burn/deposit path on GearVault

GearVault is mint-only today (audit G-MED-1 hardened it that way). Re-import needs a consume path.
Two shapes, pick one at build:

- **(a) `redeem(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount)`** — the holder calls it; it `_burn`s their token and
  emits `Redeemed(msg.sender, tokenId, amount)`. Simplest; the burn is the proof.
- **(b) Deposit-to-custody** — transfer the token to a vault-owned address that can't move it. Weaker
  (custody is a rug surface, the `omerta-contracts/CLAUDE.md` escrow rule frowns on it) — prefer (a).

**The supply-cap decision (state it explicitly):** GearVault's per-tokenId `cap`/`minted` bounds
LIFETIME mints. On a burn, does `minted` decrement (freeing cap headroom for a future extraction) or
not?
- **Do NOT decrement (recommended).** The item still exists — it just moved from chain back to game.
  Decrementing would let the SAME rarity slot be minted again later, inflating true scarcity beyond the
  signed `SUPPLY_CAP`. Keep `minted` as "lifetime extracted," so the cap is a hard ceiling on how many
  of a rarity ever left the game, re-imports notwithstanding.
- The re-import itself moves NO new supply into existence: it converts one on-chain token into one
  in-game row. In-game cars conserve by ROW COUNT (the chop/market/pink-slip precedent), so a re-import
  is a +1 row exactly matched by a −1 on-chain token. Net item count across both worlds is invariant.

**Audit note:** adding a burn path is a real change to an immutable, soon-to-be-audited contract — it
RESETS the audit clock, so it must land in the SAME audit batch as the other on-chain-items work
(`omerta-onchain-items-design.md` §3), never dribbled in after.

## 3. Double-spend, idempotency, and the guards that must hold

- **Confirmation before credit.** The watcher credits the in-game row only after `CHAIN_CONFIRMATIONS`
  on the `Redeemed` event — a reorg that un-burns the token must never leave a live in-game car behind.
- **Idempotent on the event.** Each `Redeemed` (txHash:logIndex) credits exactly once (the `vouchers` /
  `fee_payments` nonce discipline). A re-delivered log is a clean no-op.
- **The burn is the ownership proof.** Only the token holder can burn it, so only they can trigger a
  re-import to THEIR linked account. No signature-forgery surface (unlike a voucher — this direction
  needs no server signature at all; the chain event IS the authority).
- **GARAGE_CAP.** A re-imported car respects `GARAGE_CAP` like every other acquisition path (or the
  re-import is refused / queued with a clear reason — the market-win precedent already handles
  over-cap acquisition).
- **Death re-applies.** A re-imported car is a normal in-game car again — it CAN be stolen, chopped,
  raced for pinks, and it DIES WITH THE STREET unless re-extracted. Re-import is the buyer choosing to
  put a safe asset back at risk. State it in the UI: "brought back into play — it's yours to use, and
  yours to lose."

## 4. Wash-trading and the economics to sign off (BALANCE.md)

- **Self-dealing is a no-op.** Extract → sell to your own alt → re-import nets nothing (same person,
  same power, minus gas + the marketplace fee). No exploit there.
- **Buying from OTHERS is real power transfer — and that is the point of Option A.** The sim's
  car-value / racing / hauling balance assumed a rare car is earned; re-import lets it be bought. The
  founder accepts this. The dial, if it ever bites, is a **re-import cost** (an $OMR or ETH sink at
  re-import — Option D from the original scoping) that makes the marketplace a convenience rather than a
  free power buy; ship it at 0 (pure Option A) and raise it only if bought-power distorts the ladder.
- **Rarity floor = OpenSea floor.** For a power item this is the pay-to-win being accepted. Keep the
  no-appreciation-language rule: never market the floor, the "value," or the earning potential.
- **Re-extraction round-trips.** A buyer can re-import (use it), then later re-extract (death-proof it
  again to resell). Each extraction is the existing `withdraw`/mint path; each re-import the new burn
  path. The GearVault `minted` cap not decrementing (§2) means re-extraction of a re-imported item does
  NOT consume fresh cap — it re-mints the same rarity slot the burn vacated in-game. This is the one
  place the cap accounting needs care: track it as "this specific item's token can be re-minted on
  re-extraction" rather than "a new mint against the lifetime cap." Simplest correct rule: **a
  re-import burns the token but records that this item is re-extractable to the same rarity without
  counting against `SUPPLY_CAP` again** (a per-item flag, not a fresh cap draw).

## 5. Player-facing framing (founder review)

The copy must change with the mechanic. Today's line is "extracted = a trophy, not an advantage."
Under Option A it becomes something like: *"Extracted items are yours on-chain — trade them freely.
Bring one back into the game to drive it, and it's live again: yours to use, and yours to lose."* No
promise of value, no appreciation language, no earnings claim — the standing rules, which matter MORE
here because the asset now conveys power. The founder signs the exact wording.

## 6. Sequence + gates

1. Spec the GearVault burn path (§2, shape (a) `redeem`) + the re-extractable-item cap flag (§4).
2. Build it INTO the on-chain-items audit batch (never alone — it resets the clock).
3. Wire the `Redeemed` watcher + the re-import backend (decode tokenId → re-create the row, all the
   §3 guards).
4. BALANCE.md: record Option A as a signed pay-for-power pivot with the re-import-cost dial at 0.
5. Player + marketing copy (§5), founder-signed.
6. Gated on chain go-live + the third-party audit (contracts AND the new burn path), exactly like the
   rest of Door 3.

**None of this is a launch item.** The chain is dormant in production; re-import rides behind the same
gates as extraction itself.

## 7. GEAR joins the round trip (founder-directed 2026-08-21: "when items like cars or other assets
get minted as NFTs, other users should be able to buy them on an NFT marketplace and bring them back
into the game and apply them to their character") — DESIGN, gated

Cars, boats and Street Deeds already do the full loop the founder describes: buy the NFT anywhere →
`redeem()` (the burn IS the ownership proof, no server signature) → the watcher lands it on the
**burner's** linked account. GEAR — the one class that literally "applies to the character"
(`effStat` reads it at every till) — is the one class with no road back, and §0's rejection reason
was a real ambiguity, not caution: `account_gear` is SET MEMBERSHIP (one row per (account, class)),
so "re-create the row" had no defined answer when the burner already holds the class.

**The prerequisite landed first (2026-08-21, this commit): extracted gear now actually LEAVES PLAY.**
Before it, `loadOwned` never filtered `minted_onchain` out of `owned.gear`, so an extracted piece was
loot-immune AND still boosting every till — extraction was strictly free upside, contradicting the
stated tradeoff, and any re-import would have double-counted the buyer's gear. Now: `owned.gear` is
in-play only, `owned.gearOnchain` carries the extracted set (the row still holds the PK, so it blocks
a re-mint — refused honestly as `extracted`, not "you already hold it" — and dedupes kill-loot).
Test-pinned in test/chain.js + test/social.js, three mutations each failing by name.

**The three-case rule that resolves §0's ambiguity** (the deed's wait-until-deedless pattern, adapted
to set membership; a `Redeemed` gear log stays `pending` and the sweep retries forever):

1. **Burner's account has NO row for the class** → INSERT `(account, gear, minted_onchain=false)`.
   The marketplace buyer's case — the piece is theirs, live, boosting.
2. **Burner's account holds the class EXTRACTED (`minted_onchain=true`)** → flip it back to `false`.
   Their own token came home; un-flagging is exactly right here (the "never un-flag" rule in §1
   protects the ORIGINAL EXTRACTOR's row when a DIFFERENT wallet burns — that is case 1, and the
   original extractor's row… does not exist for gear: gear is fungible per class, and the burner's
   own row is the only row in question).
3. **Burner's account holds the class IN-GAME already** → wait `pending` (the deed's "already hold a
   street" rule). The burn is not lost; it applies the moment they extract or lose their in-game copy.

**Build list, in order** (all audit-batch-gated — the burn path is a contract change):
- **FREEZE THE GEAR TOKEN-ID MAP FIRST.** `gearNumId` is a positional `MARKET.findIndex + 1`; a
  MARKET reorder re-points every on-chain cap and every held token (flagged in
  AUDIT-chain-onchain.md). Re-import makes those ids LOAD-BEARING in both directions — an explicit
  frozen id map is the fix, and it must land before any gear token is worth money.
- `GearVault.redeem` accepts gear ids (or a `redeemGear`), forge tests, into the audit batch.
- `nftDecode` gains the gear inverse (fail-closed on out-of-range).
- `reimportItem` gains `kind='gear'` + the three-case rule; `nft_reimports.kind` doc updated.
- Client copy (the Collection card + the wallet card) and a `strandedItems` operator read (the
  deed's `strandedDeeds` twin — a burn from a never-linking wallet currently waits invisibly).

**The founder call this section IS (sign before build):** §0's pivot — "the marketplace becomes a
pay-for-power channel" — was signed for cars/boats, whose power is property (races, hauls). Gear is
the STAT layer: a bought-and-burned piece raises `effStat` at every contest in the game. Same
decision, materially larger. It also touches the RICO wall ("staked $OMR and minted gear are SAFE"
— unchanged: safety still applies only while on-chain) and the kill-loot economy (a re-imported
piece is lootable again — correct, and worth saying in the copy).

**SIGNED AND BUILT (founder, 2026-08-21: "Gear joins the roundtrip").** The whole build list above
landed the same day: `GEAR_TOKEN_IDS` frozen (load-guarded against MARKET membership, append-only),
`gearNumId` reads the map, `nftDecode` decodes gear (rarity null), `GearVault.redeem` accepts gear
ONE AT A TIME (`amount == 1` — each Redeemed event maps to exactly one membership change, so a
batch burn can never collapse N tokens into one membership), `applyReimport` implements the
three-case rule (account-level — a linked wallet suffices, NO living character needed, proven in
test/reimport.js with a character-less account), and `GET /v1/mod/items/stranded` names each
pending burn's reason. The `rarity` column stores `''` for gear (NOT NULL on live DBs — never an
ALTER for a sentinel); readers surface it as null.
