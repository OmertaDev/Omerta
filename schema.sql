-- burn, which rides the existing rwa:% vocabulary.
--   This was a STOCK float until 2026-07-31, when the founder retired the stock layer and directed
-- that the vault be BACKED WITH ETH instead. The change is what makes the wall hold rather than
-- weakening it: `allocated <= held` only protects a claim while BOTH SIDES ARE THE SAME ASSET. A
-- stock-denominated claim backed by ETH would be a cash-settled payout on an asset the game does not
-- own, and the treasury would go short exactly when players claim. ETH on both sides restores the
-- original property EXACTLY — the game only ever owes ETH it already holds.
--   HELD is not a table: it is Σ rwa_revenue.rwa_eth, the treasury's real inflow ledger (four ETH
-- slices — Store / gameplay fees / DEX sell tax / bond ETH). There is no buy bot and no reserve
-- table, because nothing needs buying: the backing asset arrives directly. `rwa_reserve` and

-- The founder reopened stock acquisition on 2026-08-10 — treasury ETH buys tokenized stock, and that
-- stock is distributed to NFT holders by play-weighted epoch. §3.3 then decided the stock lands
-- STRAIGHT in the NFT's bound account with NO claim gate, which is what makes these two tables
-- load-bearing rather than bookkeeping: with no gate at delivery, `allocated <= held` is the ONLY
-- wall between the treasury and owing stock it does not have.
--
-- WHY PER-TICKER UNITS AND NOT CASH VALUE. A cash-denominated version reads fine and is silently
-- wrong: value it at $X of TSLA, the price moves, and the same dollars now owe more units than the
-- treasury holds — a shortfall created by nothing anybody did. Units are the only denomination in
-- which "we owe only what we hold" is a fact rather than a snapshot. This is the same reasoning that
-- made the 2026-07-31 retirement re-denominate the vault to ETH-on-both-sides; the stock layer
-- returning means the property has to be re-established, not re-argued.
--
-- OUT-OF-BAND REAL VALUE, like every treasury table: ZERO §10.4 rows. Nothing here is a currency in
-- the conservation set, so `invariants.js` is untouched; the wall lives in `runTreasuryInvariants`.

-- What the treasury BOUGHT — one row per acquisition episode (an on-chain fill; the buy keeper is
-- step 5 and is not built, so today only the mod/QA path writes here). `real` is the anti-fabrication
-- gate the Vig, the Store, bonds and the desk all carry: a comp records the episode and books ZERO
-- units and ZERO spend. That gate matters more here than anywhere else in the project — fabricated
-- HOLDINGS are invisible to precisely the `allocated <= held` check that exists to catch them, so a
-- comp that booked units would quietly raise the ceiling on what may be delivered.

-- A locked stake counts ×mult toward the MADE_LADDER rungs (STAKE_LOCKS in rules.tail.js) and
-- refuses to unstake until the window passes. DELIBERATELY NOT a loot shield: whack:loot's
-- committed-rate leg debits `staked` directly and never consults these columns, so a locked stake
-- is looted exactly like an unlocked one — the retired "staked is safe" harbour must not come back
-- through a lock (test/made.js pins it). Account-level → survives death (the bloodline keeps its
-- word). Both are ALTERs — account_persistent is an existing table (the boot-crash lesson) — and
-- both are OFF persistAccount's positional list (written by direct SQL under the held account lock).

-- outside the death-disposition guard by construction and holds no value (§10.4-zero). A NEW table,
-- so CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is live-DB-safe (only new COLUMNS on existing tables need ALTERs).

-- additive-only discipline makes it safe; the stamp makes it visible). Written by src/db.js:stampSchema
-- after every boot-time schema apply. A NEW table, so CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is live-DB-safe.
